This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform . I've played many different first-person shooters , and I've never really liked any of them much , but this game has a certain something that I can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun . Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game . Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters . Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons . Maybe it's the suave character of James Bond . Whatever it is , this game never seems to get old no matter how many times I've played it .
Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney , anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater . Once again , someone in Hollywood dares to create something different . This time it was those zanie ( for a temporary lack of a better word ) Coens doing " their thing " to one of the great works in literary history . Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind ? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood , but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library . It is one of those films that you can watch over and over . The story is brilliantly written . Clean and entertaining , with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame , great performances by Clooney , Turturro , Nelson , and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter . Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south , I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this . They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south . You are NOT doing anything better this weekend , go see this movie ! < br / > < br / >
I was really surprised , that my mom watched whole movie without leaving to iron , clean or some other things like these . And I was almost shocked , when she said , it was very funny and very interesting . And I think so .
I went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter , good cast , a director who had previously done the highly-rated " Once Were Warriors " and my liking for noir-ish films set in L . A . in the Forties and Fifties . I would argue that I am reasonably easy to please in this film category ; I appreciate the classics of the genre but I will sit through and enjoy a half-decent if derivative effort as well . However , I found this film completely unbearable . < br / > < br / > Despite a good situation in which to place the story , nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two-hours plus of this sorry mess . Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing . The narrative is slack and drags unbearably , and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death . There is no drama , no atmosphere , no tension , absolutely no entertainment value and by the end I simply didn't care what happened because I did not believe in anything in the film . < br / > < br / > L . A . Confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true-to-life , the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department . Mulholland Falls by contrast fails in every department , a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved . If they ever show this on a plane I will still walk out .
" The Brotherhood of Satan " is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction ( Bernard McEveety ) . It all starts out with father Charles Bateman ( as Ben ) driving out west with his pretty blondes : luscious Ahna Capri ( as Nicky ) , and daughter Geri Reischl ( as K . T . ) . Things get weirder and weirder for the trio , as they approach the town of Hillsboro , which is being gripped by a Satanic cult ! < br / > < br / > When the dullish travelers hit Hillsboro , the " action " switches to the film's more interesting assemblage of characters : townies L . Q . Jones ( as Pete , the sheriff ) , Strother Martin ( as Doc ) , Charles Robinson ( as Jack , the priest ) , and Alvy Moore ( as Tobey ) . Their interplay is sometimes fun . Soon enough , it all gets very silly , and predictable . Mr . Martin is the stand-out ( as you might expect ); he considers the possibility of a Satanic cult to be a " cock-and-bull story " , but is ( of course ) their leader . The " Come in , Children " ending is puzzling ; unless , perhaps , it was the film's original title .
After a long hard night being partied away at the Walkabout in Islington , I needed a pick-me-up . My throat hurt , my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol . Today , I watched " Red Sonja " and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do right now . Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained . Yep , it's that good . < br / > < br / > " Red Sonja " isn't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy . In fact , the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before " Lord Of The Rings " was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly " Willow " . Perhaps , in view of this , one should go a little easy on this film . But I can't - it's poorly written , badly acted ( with the exception of Paul Smith , who's just average ) and dreadfully put together . The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones , with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock . Considering the comic-book source material , it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies . Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid , in this world or that one , is bewildering . His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch . Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions , a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in " The Terminator " . < br / > < br / > It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film , by any stretch of the imagination . When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out , in that distinctive Germanic accent , " she's dead " then you know you're in for a rough ride . A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points , such as the priestesses of a temple who , when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground , seemed to enjoy the experience - at least , judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place . If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn , watch " Willow " ( but never take that as a ringing endorsement ) . For the real thing , take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with " Lord Of The Rings " . Trust me , 11 Oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody " Titanic " .
I recall years back , Michael Douglas wanted his wife , Catherine Zeta-Jones , to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods . No doubt she does , but NOT in this film . A colossal waste of time , no story , no character development , no chemistry , nada . This was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be , boring and a HUGE disappointment . Didn't even watch the whole film , torture . Catherine Zeta-Jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen , move around , present a dish but this wasn't the food network , nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared , supposedly a romantic interest brewing , where was the chemistry . The poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there . The loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness . The sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in , NOT . Just a waste of movie time . The promoters certainly did their job to put this lack-luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers . Sorry to say , don't spend a dime .
Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this , but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright . Except in this case it doesn't . Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas , ( he wrote " The Robe " ) , and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor , it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra . < br / > < br / > Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight . To make amends he takes up medicine , becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it . ( No , it sin't quite that daft ; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy ) . In between times , they fall in love . < br / > < br / > Try as I might I can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of American mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirk's films , ( this one isn't too deep ) . On the plus side Rock Hudson isn't half bad , ( I think I am rediscovering him ) , and , of course , it looks great , ( in Sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals ) . Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime TV .
When you think of golf movies , you think of Caddyshack , but what if there are kids around ? Go right to this movie ! Disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy . The acting in this movie , in my opinion , is quite good and the leading cast , for the most part , is very young ! This movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique , seeing all the angles of the golf game . I think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch . Though the ending might be a little predictable , the movie does well on its own ! It also shows that you do not need swearing , nudity , or violence to make a great golf movie !
Recap : A band of five young American men , all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during the WWII get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity . They're in really bad condition , both physically and mentally , and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food . But after a while there is some enemy activity , and it is very odd . Not hostile , but odd . It seems like there is a German squad out there , in equally bad condition , that want nothing more than to surrender . < br / > < br / > Comments : Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen . Indeed it is a different war movie , much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles . But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense , full of uncertainties and unknown elements , just fall flat in the movie . It is not suspenseful , just different and in many ways absurd . Many times people just act insane , and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at . < br / > < br / > So when this mental pressure fails to come through , the main building piece of the entire story , I thought the story fell through . It wasn't good , it wasn't interesting , it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message . Actually it did nothing . < br / > < br / > The cast is interesting , many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers . The acting is good , but not stellar , and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone . Much of that too I feel is due to that this story , these characters need the time , space and pace given in a novel , that they can't be given here . And going halfway definitely isn't good enough . < br / > < br / > 4/10
I have seen both the MST 3K version and the uncut version . I rather enjoyed it . Either way , it wasn't that bad of a movie . Sure it moved a bit slow at times . I liked it . < br / > < br / > As far as MST 3K goes , they only did the movies they could get the rights for . Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies , it was just so easy to make fun of them . Take SoulTaker for example . < br / > < br / > Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh . I couldn't take them seriously . It really created a unique feeling though . < br / > < br / > Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script . A world better than 95 % of the garbage in the theatres today . Her role was played well . Not too screamy not to masculine but just right . The camera really likes her in this movie . I would have casted her in that role after ready the script . < br / > < br / > Anyways , this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given . Please watch the uncut version if you see the MST 3K . It deserves that much .
The above profile was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf 56 which is still my email address . I still believe Andy Devine's character of Frisky is the best Twilight Zone's episodes ever and I watch this episode at least once a year as I consider Frisby to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly . < br / > < br / > In case many of you are too young to remember , I'm 61 , Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50 ' s I believe called Andy's Gang . On it he had three assistants : a cat named Midnight who played the violin , a mouse named Squeaky who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named Froggy who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of Andy's funny guest stars like Billy Gilbert .
I've been a devoted IMDB visitor for a few years . This is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review . < br / > < br / > I caught this movie by chance ( the opening credits happened to be scrolling past when I turned my TV on one morning ) . I thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons , all of which have been well covered by other reviewers - - the moodiness , the forgotten history of the Czech pilots , the subtle charm of the supporting characters , the fatalism of the main characters , and the first person view during the battle scenes . < br / > < br / > But the element of " Dark Blue World " that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects , especially during combat ( and this is a good thing ! ) . While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them , no manipulative shots of worried spouses / girlfriends were interwoven , every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers , and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable James Bond-esque pilot heroics . Instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy , fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat . As comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical ( but audience pleasing ) revenge based heroics . Instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot's fate - - in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment . We only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we , the audience , witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death . And then immediately ' we ' need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival . < br / > < br / > Too often in Hollywood we're spoon-fed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination . " Dark Blue World " maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer , allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings . < br / > < br / > Excellent film , well worth seeing .
I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February of 1983 . I was in the hospital , having just given birth to my first and only child . I'll refrain from telling you the extent to which I was moved . Suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day , almost 23 years later . I hope I can find a copy of this movie , if such a thing was ever made . This movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it . However , I must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me . This way , it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it . I never saw Ms . Margaret perform a better part . Nor have I ever seen her in a more convincing role . I will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part .
I was disappointed with the third film in the " Death Wish " series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into Bronson . He is his usual self in this one , maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others ; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T . V . - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen , even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated . The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does , it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness . The plot is something out of an episode of " Highway to Heaven " and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys . Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend .
Bwana Devil is reputedly the first major studio , full length feature filmed entirely in the 3D process . Supposedly producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot a different movie , but after hearing the tale of two man-eating lions , terrorizing railway builders , decided on this one . It's a good story too , almost Hemmingway-like ; fear , redemption , the great white hunter and all . It's the telling of the story that seems to drag , almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew . The action scenes are stiff , almost too staged . But these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion .
I just got home from seeing " Radio . " I've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time . My kids are ages 8 and 5 and I would like to take them so that they may " feel " the message as I did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are , not judge them for their differences . Cuba Gooding , Jr . and Ed Harris both deserve Academy Awards for this movie . I don't know why we can't have more movies like this , rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis .
This movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless . It's awful , you can forget plot or decent acting , cause it's not there . And with the dismissal of any decent story or acting or even the trait of being mildy frightening then there is usually only one plus left for a horror film . The appeal to those who like soft core porn . This film doesn't even have that . The women show a little skin , but not really anymore than say the Xena show . Except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor , and I mean poor sex scenes . So in short if you like good movies you have no interest in this film , if you like cheese you still don't have any reason to rent this film , if you like erotica and soft core porn you really have no motive to rent this film , and most importantly if you value your time in the slightest , you cannot do better than to avoid this movie .
This is a awful re-make of a very good movie called " Up In The Air " starring Frankie Darrow , Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds . I was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off . Almost all the lines are identical , I have no idea why they would re-do the movie . I totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs ( there the same also ) , In the original the singing is first rate , I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually did her own singing , it's hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later , and the songs are very good , surprising in a " B " movie . If you get the chance see the original it's available on DVD . You'll be pleasantly surprised .
I saw this film at Temple University . I cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater ( projected on film ) . The acting is similar to Saved By The Bell ( The TV Show ) . The plot is simple and unimaginative . The sound recordist likes the sound of wind and the DP needs a light meter . Vampires , Vampires , Vampires . < br / > < br / > Don't waste your money .
I loved Heavenly Creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on . < br / > < br / > So , imagine my delight when I discovered Love & Suicide while browsing NetFlix . Echoing Heavenly Creatures , an easy choice , to the top of my queue it went . < br / > < br / > I watched it last , made myself comfy , and waited . What I thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project ( I laughed out loud once or twice , thinking " that just lowered the bar of straight to video " ) turned out to be the movie . Horrible acting , amateur direction , weak dialog . I usually enjoy low budget films , there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the " meat "   the acting , the direction , the plot , the story . I would liken it to a student who hasn't studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps . < br / > < br / > In someone else's hands the plot would have serious potential . < br / > < br / > Do not expect magic or even a cult classics like , say , Divine's Polyester , or Showgirls , at least there you learn to expect bad acting . < br / > < br / > Love & Suicide went from bad , to worse , to the WORST movie I have ever seen .
What . Uh ... < br / > < br / > This movie is so dissociative and messed up that I literally lost a bit of my sanity after it was over . I will never be the same person again . I'm trying to put my finger on what , exactly , is so completely insane about it ... It's not just the hilarious techno music , or the " outside of time " medieval / Blade Runner / wild west / Highlander setting , or the weird CGI " Grendel " monster that looks like a man made out of animated sausages , or even the " Grendel's mother " monster , which looks like some Alabama table-dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed in the tanning bed too long . All of those things are weird , but what's really the strangest thing in this movie is the acting . I simply can't explain . This script is obviously , hellishly silly , but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all . Lambert is always weird , and usually kind of boring , but for this one he's gone into Dolph Lundgrin territory : I can't help but just start laughing every time he talks . < br / > < br / > I will give this movie some credit for being completely scatter-brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring . I'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one . < br / > < br / > Warning : if you are planning on watching Christopher Lambert as Beowulf , be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish , hyperactive-catatonic daze . It's true . When I was done with my Beowulf spirit journey , I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk . There was a dead wolf lying next to me , and I later found I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket . My VHS copy of Beowulf was sitting on a hastily-constructed stone altar nearby , enshrined with candles and wilted flowers . The tape told me to walk . I rose and I walked .
The cookie-cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story . The plot , such as it is , has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it . Suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face . Even the soundtrack is awful ! Its not that I dislike figure skating , although I don't , its that I dislike cliched , bad movies .
After the lush , inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie , this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end . < br / > < br / > Where to begin , well I'll start with the characters . I really enjoyed them in the book , here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had " Victim " or " Asshole " written on their foreheads from the get go . How any one didn't see through the store owner Lealand Gaunt ( in a hammy and out of place performance by Sydrow ) is beyond me . < br / > < br / > This film lacks in thrills , suspense , and in some sense yes , entertaining values . It stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off . Why introduce too many annoying should-die-quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through ? In the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate . Here , besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel ( the fight between Wilma and Nettie ) , was a letdown and didn't have much balls . I'm sorry but after , one off screen death , a boring shoot off , and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me . The brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing . The explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed , all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl ? It made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are , who are these people and why should I care ? < br / > < br / > The story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum . I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this , but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn . Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic ( in the novel she was a sad and depressing character ) here it was a too one note . J . T . Walsh was entertaining , but the role was far from interesting or layered . Too predictable . < br / > < br / > The soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting . It stood out like sore thumb . Easy there buddy , easy . Something a little less theatrical I'd assume would have worked . < br / > < br / > I will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough I guess , The director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though . If your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of Kings better novels . < br / > < br / > I often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously ( Ed Harris speech at the end , or the character Hugh Priest in general ) , and was bored and uninterested most of the other time . Personally the director should have done so much more with this story , his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie . The movie looks good , but not the look I think this story deserved . I mean , this dude helmed ALASKA , not a good sign . < br / > < br / > I'd rather just read the book , as you should too as if it is far more entertaining , layered character development , grisly violence and mayhem , a nasty sense of humour , and far more oomph . This is a butchered version , that has not much to offer . < br / > < br / > * * out of * * *
Although flawed in it's view of homosexuals , this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning AIDS . Despite the depressing subject matter , this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys , and will make you laugh as well as cry . Very well-acted by all , especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro . The language is a little strong , though appropriate , and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family . But remember to have the Kleenex ready !
" Sweeney Todd " is in my opinion one of a few " perfect " musicals . Like " My Fair Lady " and " West Side Story " it has a wonderful , intelligent score . It offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles . It has a timeless theme , revenge . It has a good deal of humor , and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale . < br / > < br / > " Sweeney Todd " tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in England . It shows mans ' inhumanity to man , how in Sweeney's own words , " There are two kinds of men . There's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face . " In an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him , Mr . Todd devices a plan to seek revenge . With the help of Mrs . Lovett , who owns a meat pie shop under Mr.Todd ' s barbershop , they set out to have " those above , serve those down below " . < br / > < br / > I was fortunate enough to have seen the original Broadway version eight times ( six with Cariou and Lansbury , the other two with Hearn and Loudon ) . I saw the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler , and several other concert versions . < br / > < br / > While the technical aspects in this production are lacking , to say the least , I believe that this filmed production version is the best . Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles , and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other . < br / > < br / > Very good supporting work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck . Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal , as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry , and are basically unwatchable . < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10
The problem this film has is the same problem the TV series had and that ` s the laddish Stan and Jack . There ` s nothing wrong with laddish characters but Stan and Jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s / early 50s ! And there ` s something objectionable - not to mention crediblity defying - as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughters < br / > < br / > As for the rest of HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES , I found it instantly forgettable . It ` s basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus station < br / > < br / > Amazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10 ! Come on guys , this film doesn ` t deserve more than a 5
" The Man Who Knew Too Much " ( 1955 ) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple ( James Stewart and Doris Day ) on vacation in Morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder , espionage , assassinations and the worst of all , kidnapping of their 10 - years-old son . The movie which Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun . Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together . The film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense . < br / > < br / > The inclusion of " Que Sera , Sera " proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like " Que Sera , Sera " did in " The Man Who Knew Too Much " . < br / > < br / > Hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from Arthur Benjamin " Storm Cloud Cantata " for almost ten minutes while scene in London's Royal Albert Hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both , the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous .
The preposterous premise of this flick has to do with Argentina reclaiming the Falkland Islands , having failed through force in 1982 , by impregnating the European women inhabitants with Argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored Argentina . Yeah , right . The reconnaissance is done by our hero / villan and cad , Fabian , who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the Falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman , Camilla . An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary , this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip ... yada , yada , yada . The film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed . " F * ckland " is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak , no frills , jigglecam austerity of Dogme indies .
First , a word of caution . The DVD box describes this film as a comedy . I don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons . While light and a little bit funny in places , it is NOT a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed . < br / > < br / > I had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other . Considering that the other two DVDs I picked up were big disappointments , I was so happy when I saw this film . The acting , writing and direction were excellent . The story itself definitely interested me , as you don't usually see films about the final month of France before the Nazi takeover in 1940 . It gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to partitioning their beloved country . Along the way , there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by Isabelle Adjani--who looks marvelous after all these years . She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall . This sap escapes from prison and finds her--with another lover--a high government official and weasel played by Gerard Depardieu . In addition , a subplot about a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot . The story has a lot of nice twists and turns , a light sense of humor ( without trying to be a comedy ) and some genuine suspenseful moments . Together , they create a nice package this is sure to please .
After cleaning up Dodge City ( with a little help from Wyatt Earp ) Bat Masterson goes to Liberal , Kansas where they've got a nice little range war going . Plus a rather interesting scheme of sharecropping . < br / > < br / > Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he's after villains Billy House and Steve Brodie who are driving homesteaders off their farms . The homesteaders they are driving off are in a sharecropping scheme financed by Robert Ryan . Seems as though he's staking the various farmers to a parcel of land to homestead for a percentage of profit from their crop . Ryan's about to lose his shirt as a result of all the shenanigans . < br / > < br / > As portrayed by Scott , Bat Masterson is a stand-up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter which we all know he did later in life . < br / > < br / > Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan which is a little silly and does detract from the action . Anne Jeffreys does sing nice though . < br / > < br / > Of course Gabby Hayes as always provides the great comic relief . < br / > < br / > A good addition to the Randolph Scott collection of westerns . Also interesting because his later western films don't have him as wearing a hat as white as the one here . < br / > < br / > This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of the Professional Bull Riders who is a proud resident of Liberal , Kansas , a town with a great tradition whether Bat Masterson marshaled there or not .
It's amazing that this no talent actor Chapa got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal , pathetic , cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half Mexican , much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old , i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as Dunaway , Wagner , Keach , Tilly and Busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film . I doubt many people have ever heard of Chapa and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs .
No ! no - No - NO ! My entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie . I knew we were heading for trouble from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing - literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging . Meg Ryan playing Meg Ryan - how tiresome is that ? ! And it got worse ... so much worse . The horribly cliché lines , the stock characters , the increasing sense I was watching a spin-off of " The First Wives Club " and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room . How many times have I seen this movie ? Only once , but it feel like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it . For shame !
Lord have mercy ! Why was this film made ? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to be in it ? The Foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind . < br / > < br / > The film has an ultra-cheap look to it . Like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach . What's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate . The result is a film that just don't look right . The fight scenes are so dull and edited ' discretely ' to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is not in good shape anymore . None of them are engaging or exciting . The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it . The Eastern-Europe locations ( a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down , or non-existent ) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an ' action ' film ( what action ? ) . < br / > < br / > And what is the deal with the title ? As far as I could tell everyone in the movie was foreign . Which ONE does the title refer to ? < br / > < br / > The DVD is in 1.85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 sound . Neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent . The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time . Gotta love that tagline tho ! ' If they think they can stop him , they're dead wrong . ' Sheesh !
" House of Dracula " isn't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times . < br / > < br / > * * SPOILERS * * < br / > < br / > Arriving at the home of Dr . Franz Edelmann , ( Onslow Stevens ) in his seaside home , Count Dracula , ( John Carradine ) discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism . He starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion , the Wolf Man , Lawrence Talbot , ( Lon Chaney Jr . ) arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy . Working with the two patients , he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory , and after searching the area , he finds the Frankenstein Monster , ( Glenn Strange ) buried nearby . Becoming obsessed with reviving it , Dr . Edelmann keeps neglecting Dracula and Larry's requests , and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the Monster , they turn on each other in a climactic showdown . < br / > < br / > The Good News : This was a rather decent film . There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative . This is the first film to openly propose the idea of vampirism as a blood disease , and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid , something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this . There's even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition . It works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea , even if some of the execution is a little stale . The fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea . The Wolf Man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy . Dracula's initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive . The Monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused . The large bat that Dracula transforms into always looks decent for once , and is quite realistically done . It's a thoroughly decent affair . < br / > < br / > The Bad News : There are several things that weren't all that great about this one . The fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really doesn't know what to do with them . There are several different back-stories that have to be mingled together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent . This really doesn't have any of that . The plot is rather flimsy and doesn't really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars , and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending . The monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction . The ending is for once a big let-down , and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute . There's a few other small things that weren't all that spectacular , and pretty much also contribute to this . < br / > < br / > The Final Verdict : It's quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style . Nowhere near the classic status of each monsters ' debut features , but it's a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of Universal films in general . < br / > < br / > Today's Rating-PG : Violence
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here . It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth . < br / > < br / > From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment . Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle , which makes for superior suspense . Note to horror filmmakers : some of us do like subtlety ! Lovely and homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor , who we all know isn't a doctor at all . The suspense is built through Charlotte's unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients , but which of the patients can Charlotte trust ? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie . I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY crowd . < br / > < br / > VIOLENCE : $ $ $ ( Quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film . The opening scene is classic ; no other horror film starts out better , and the end has its fair share of gore as well ) . < br / > < br / > NUDITY : $ $ $ ( Eager to fall in love Allyson ( Betty Chandler ) spends a good deal of time naked , attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium . Betty Chandler is a knockout and I am shocked that this is her only film credit ) . < br / > < br / > STORY : $ $ $ ( The story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in Hollywood . The script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation ) . < br / > < br / > ACTING : $ $ $ ( Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson , capturing dementia with naiveté in an ethereal form . The Judge was splendid as well , weighing facts before he came to a verdict while Rosie Holotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character .
This movie is great . Stylish , fun , good acting . I'd seen it described variously as ' Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Muskets ' and ' Reservoir Fops ' , both of which are excellent descriptions . The plot is simple , but it does not detract from the enjoyment . Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunken gentleman . The sets and costumes are stunning , and the music and camerawork are refleshingly unusual for a ' costume drama ' . Sense and Sensibility it definitely is not ! ! ! My recommendation ? Go see it , sit back with a huge tub of popcorn and have a damn good time .
This is one of the best presentations of the 60 ' s put on film . Arthur Penn , director of Bonnie and Clyde and Little Big Man , saw that Steve Tesich's outstanding script rang with truth , and from these two talents comes solid cinema . Jodi Thelin's Georgia Miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps , but , always just out of reach . Just see it , or you cinematic education will be incomplete .
Perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny . Maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it . But what I got out of it was actually something that many people believe in . And that is , " Nice guys finish last " . < br / > < br / > There is a line in Angel Heart from Lisa Bonet's character that says " It takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster . " True . Most likely . Women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever . But ( at least at an early age ) they end up going for the good looking , slimy , disrespectful , untamed guy . The one they know they can't conform to their beliefs . And that is part of the attraction . After all , what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be ? I believe this may have happened to Boaz Davidson . And what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to , is that you will get your heart broken . It happens to everyone and it will happen to you . And that is a strong final statement in the film . But having said all that , the movie is fun . It is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well . < br / > < br / > This is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it ; s like to get your heart broken . No highschool film has ever done this better . Like I said , I think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand . Maybe we all have . < br / > < br / > This is an old film , but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night , pick it up , you may be surprised . It is a hell of a lot better than Never Been Kissed .
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them ... The film has its moments , and its concepts , the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea ... If this movie were remade with a few good actors / actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome ... As for the actual film , I recommend watching the MST 3K version , the pure version might be too boring to sit through , unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother ...
This love story between an American journalist and an Eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict , since she is largely Westernized ( having studied in London ) , nor any fireworks , since she behaves rather restrained . What little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs . They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals , but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a Hollywood hack who is not much of one himself . The movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded little Hongkong , overrun by a million Chinese refugees ? And a presumably accomplished American journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is ? Hollywood ideas . Finally " the song " . After hearing it an estimated twenty times throughout the movie , starting right with the credits , it tends to loose some of its emotional impact , sorry to say .
I am a fifth grade language arts teacher , and after we read this book ( which the students loved ) , then we watched the movie . They laughed out loud ! Unfortunately , it's NOT a comedy ! The acting was so awful , I felt like I was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play . My students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through . I have to agree with them , at times , it was pretty bad . Still , I would show it to students again , just for fun , and to compare the film with the book . We did a Venn Diagram ( teachers know what that is ) afterward , to show what was the same in both and what were the differences , so there is an educational value in showing it . I noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better !
" The Twins Effect " is the worst movie I've seen ! Not only is the support weak , but the characters as well . I'm sorry to say to you Edison fans , but Kazaf is by far the weakest Vampire I've seen in my life . I'm sorry Edison ; your role in this movie was disappointing . Edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and I'm sure if they didn't have Kazaf in the movie , the plot wouldn't be much different . The main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship . I mean , who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood ? Yeah , he's the prince right ? So what ! < br / > < br / > Certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid . Yeah , the action was great but the entire outline of it was stupid . In one scene towards the end , Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown . Why would you wait until he's grown up to attack ? Another scene was with Jackie Chan , one of my personal favorites . In the scene , Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them . How can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires ? People are dying around them with bite marks on their necks ; surely the NEWS would be on it faster than you can say " Vampire . " < br / > < br / > The characters were yet another mistake in the movie . Helen , played by Charlene Choi , is the girlfriend of Kazaf . What kind of girl would not be scared of Vampires , especially if it is your brother's job to kill them ? I can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as Helen if you searched your whole life . Helen is annoying , bitchy , and is a total drama queen in the movie . She tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably . One of the weirdest and most disturbing characters I've seen in any movie . Why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire ? It's very odd that her reaction to Kazaf's confession doesn't turn him off . Kazaf , played by Edison Chen , is another stupid character in the story . How degrading for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role . He does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight . Although I'm a fan of Edison , I wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time . Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie . Their love is pure and sweet . Gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like Helen . Reeve , played by Ekin Cheng , is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie . A plot failure was the death of Reeve . The movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by removing one of the only likable characters . Another character was Duke Dekotes . The story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain Kazaf's " rock " seem irrelevant . < br / > < br / > It's very sad because towards the end of the movie , I was forcing myself to watch because I so desperately wanted to see Kazaf fight . The end was so abrupt because the whole time I was expecting so great to happen . Kazaf , who's the supposed Vampire Prince , does nothing for the movie and I'm sure if he were taken out , the movie wouldn't be much different . I highly recommend you to NOT waste your time on this movie as I have . I was greatly disappointed . If you're in search of a great movie , why not watch " Lord of the Rings " or " Pirates of the Caribbean ? " Likeable characters with a well-written plot .
... than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie . What was the motive ? The details of the murders were used , but never explained . I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere , which is great , but the story is definitely lacking . There is no thread to follow . I guess if that was done properly , the movie would've lasted a bit longer , but it would've been worth it , at least for me . < br / > < br / > Casting is very good , I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky . < br / > < br / > Not much more to say , really . But I really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious . < br / > < br / >
This all looked quite promising . An up-and-coming Presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders , as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the White House . It stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors . Yet very few people have a good word to say about it . < br / > < br / > The whole thing really needed some depth . You can pick up the idea that the President is being too left-wing with his ideas , and some within the Government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out . Conrad appears to simply want the country to be Governed his way , rather than the way of the elected leader . < br / > < br / > However , the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned , and the rather haphazard assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired . Her ' the President's my Father ' ' diversion ' was ludicrous - that would make the President about 10 when that happened . Worse still was her predictable final scene with Bishop . < br / > < br / > They could have made a challenging , inventive political thriller , but either bottled it or failed . They could've gone to town on special effects , but the good ones were wasted . They could have achieved so much more in general . This was barely worth the £ 1 it cost me .
Once you sit down to see this film " A Cannon for Cordoba " you get the feeling it's going to be a great . The reason ? The film begins with a rousing score by noted composer Elmer Bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as ' The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven . ' Indeed , when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than George Peppard as Capt . Rod Douglas , you know it's going to have action and lot's of it . Furthermore when you see actor John Russel playing General John J . Pershing , you know you're in for a heroic saga . The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the U . S . in a border town dispute with the Mexican bandits who cross the Rio Grande in the early 1900s . Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General Cordova ( Raf Vallone ) . With his army of Mexican revolutionaries , he attacks Pershing , kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces . Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally , Capt . Douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission , without orders and without aid from Pershing . His mission is to retrieve the Cannons , destroy a rebel stronghold and bring Cordova back alive . Selecting the roughest , toughest , most experienced , certainly the most insolent men available , Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress . Dramatic action follows , as does lots of explosive excitement . If one is asks for criticism , I would say the choice of heavies . Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing . Not so with the men who side with Peppard . Pete Duel and Don Gordon ( Who is superb . ) Nevertheless , this movie is recommended as good viewing . * * *
My brother was working at a movie theater when I saw this movie ; I saw it for free and still walked out . I have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst . When people ask me what the worst movie I have ever seen was I mention this movie in less than one second . This movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set-up to the next , it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful . If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie . Okay , this movie is not good " bad " but terrible bad . If you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun , like me , you will not even be able to make it through this very short film . Please for the love of God destroy all copies of this movie .
I enjoyed this for a couple of reasons . The emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved , but the blend of newsreel footage with the film's narrative was often compelling . The other element that I appreciated was the depiction of the Werewolves , the fanatical Nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender . I don't know of another film that deals with them . They assassinated Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen on Palm Sunday , 1945 , for example , and did create problems for the occupation . The film , then , challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities . The " human issues " are presented not so much through the characters here , but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived Hitler - - both conquered and victors .
Have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades ? If you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already - and I can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies . < br / > < br / > The story ( I'm sure that true storytellers will never forgive me ) is childish and stupid ( stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead ) . Every character is based in a cliché and ... well , they're nothing but the cliché . And yes , again all you need to be a hero is to be American . < br / > < br / > At least in Finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the DVD was made for . Maybe I should sell my player then ... < br / > < br / > 1/10
Calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic . Heck , you can't even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average ( it's funny , but not " haha-funny , you know ) . But still I'd say to give it a look . If only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it . By the way , all those people who're complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame . When you see the DVD-cover of this film , you should already know that it's not going to be on the same level as " The Piano " for example , so don't come complaining afterwards ... < br / > < br / > Evil Ed could've been something but the totally screwed it up . I suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing ' cutting-committee ' in horror nowadays . It shows an editor named Edward who's slowly ( well , not too slowly ) going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced . The big boss is named Sam Campbell ... Funny , isn't it ? Personally I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi , but to my surprise there wasn't . Anyway , this guy became rich by making movies called " Loose Limbs " . They feature ( and I'm not kidding you ! ) scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a BEAVER ( ? ) and then gets shot in the head by a bazooka ! ! ! Now , who says horror isn't original anymore ? < br / > < br / > With all the gore and the ' loose limbs ' , it's hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick . After a decent first 25 minutes , Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from that . The only think left to do then ( besides pushing the eject-button , of course ) is look for the obvious amount of references to other , much better horror films . I saw scenes obviously stolen from The Evil Dead , Silence of the Lambs , Braindead and several others.And there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well . < br / > < br / > Evil Ed finds it origin in Sweden . I'm convinced there's a lot up talent there , far North ( take the Danish " Nattevagten " as an example ) ... but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed . Only to see if you're in a dumb mood and you don't want to use your brain at all .
Geesh , I never , ever , ever thought I'd write the above four words . But , actually , she's the highpoint of this little flick . < br / > < br / > As the movie was packaged when I rented it , it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication , which keeps her stable . It sounded like a cute concept . For years , all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull , lifeless TV movies . It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little , and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy , she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie , I figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel . < br / > < br / > Wrong . < br / > < br / > Instead , Spelling's part is small , and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines . When she's not on the screen , the movie crawls so badly , I could've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape . This would've worked so much better if Spelling's storyline had dominated , and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil , the least irritating kidnapper .
One of Fuller's ( a combat veteran himself ) early works of average quality , but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar Germany . The main character starts the movie in Apr ' 45 as a Sgt with C Co , 157th Inf , 45th Div , which really did end the war in Munich as in the movie . ( Same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in Aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the Dachau facility ) . To the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good & bad of the german people . But anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45-47 Germany . The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor : while on a boat cruise of the Rhine passing the remains of the Remagen bridge he comments he crossed there . But his unit really crossed well south of there - north of Worms Germany .
Legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey about an actor / makeup man who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is tossed in his face as he is lighting up a cigarette . Reduced to a scarred mess and wearing an eye patch Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum . He also kidnaps and kills people using a solution which paralyzes them so he can turn them into displays . Genuinely bizarre bad movie that defies description . Watch as the various wax figures try not to move , watch as the entire tobacco out put for several Southern states is consumed watch as things just get weirder and weirder . Its an awful train wreck of a movie and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen . A classic bad movie that will amaze you even as it leaves permanent scars on your psyche .
Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com . Had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy ... < br / > < br / > Have to say that I was not impressed . The production values are cheap , the story is derivative , the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs . < br / > < br / > I wanted to like this but I just found it lackluster and dull . Or maybe I expected more of independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes . < br / > < br / > There are bits in the film that make no sense at all , like one of the Leather Bear's trying to get Ecki in a sling - - like he'd even look at him twice ? Or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband ? Bunkum is not the word ! Well , at least it explains the movies UK title , I suppose ...
This film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life . I laughed so hard while watching this . The movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with . The movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character , and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing . The campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master , Lodge , is writing . The problem is Lodge can't finish his module because the characters can't finish the campaign . They are more for killing and looting instead of role playing . Lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before . They decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a , wait for it , girl in to play . Lodge also makes a npc , a non player character , a paladin , who can not witness or do wrong , to play . The film is how they do all this and more I don't want to spoil any of the film so I won't say any more . This movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be Oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it . They had a lot of fun making this film and it shows I am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun . There is some slap stick comedy which I enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion . So if you want a fun film try it .
Overall I found this film good : exceptional acting with disturbing scenes ( some essential , some useless ) and weak second half . CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided in 2 parts . I thought the first half of the Pianist was terrific . We meet Erika Kohut ( wonderful Isabelle Huppert ) , a piano teacher , and get introduced to her world . She is single , struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother . We understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry : she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people , releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops , as a voyeur , or in sadistic self-mutilations ... This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film , almost unbearable . < br / > < br / > Then comes Walter , a young , handsome and outgoing man ( played superbly by Benoit Magimel ) . Though he gets to feel Erika's coldness in the beginning , he seduces her and slowly wreaks Erika's fortress . He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires . Then when she is about to fall for him , he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all ( especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love ) . This is the second half of the film , very touching as we see Erika's inability / inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction . This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke , and sometimes had non-credible ( ie . too shocking ) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama . < br / > < br / > Of course , this is a crude film at least in the French version : you see porn sequences from the sex shop , daring mutilation and sex scenes . The much talked-about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good I thought , and is central to understand Erika's sick relation to love . As to the actors , Huppert is marvelous all through the film , Magimel gets better and better up to perfection , and Girardot ( the mother ) is excellent . < br / > < br / >
An eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious sect compound near Waco , Texas . Seventy-six people , including sect leader , David Koresh , perished in a flaming inferno that destroyed the compound . There is still heated debate over how the fire started . Homicide or suicide ? Can you still trust government ethics ? < br / > < br / >
Being a HUGE fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film . I was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride ... alas . < br / > < br / > Where to start on this mess ? i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny . I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut . < br / > < br / > The overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the ' terrible ' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run , but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created . < br / > < br / > The acting , at times , is pathetic.Fenella Fielding is wasted as the loony Mrs Foxfur and i've seen Simon Pegg have much better outings . < br / > < br / > I'd recommend Guest House Paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.But to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
... so why on Earth would I see ' Sex Lives of the Potato Men ' ? Answer : Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook . Vegas I have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed . I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness . Crook I know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with ' Alan Partridge ' , ' The Office ' . As Gareth he was simply hilarious , and I was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen . < br / > < br / > OK . So me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny , only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter Ferris and Dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook . They are destined for better things ( have done better already infact ) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent straight actor . The trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching , although the * * SPOILER * * tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened , it just wasnt believable . And throughout the film Vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times . < br / > < br / > The film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old , well , grotesque , when sex was mentioned . Not , I add , when it was shown on screen . Tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny , and just made me feel a little bit ill . Also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy picking his nose , before showing a close up of the bogey on his finger . Just him picking his nose would have raised a smile , he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible , but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank . < br / > < br / > One scene I did think was hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the threesome . His blokish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes arent always endless ecstasy . Not that I'd know ... < br / > < br / > That's about all I can say really . I will end with this , and this is actually my main critique of the film . This is supposed to revive the British film industry . It is no ' Trainspotting ' that is for sure ... it isn't even a ' Love Actually ' ( you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one ) , and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project . ' Mike Basset England Manager ' was a wonderful little known British comedy and was made for far less than 3 million . I only hope that the BFC will learn from ' Sex Lives of the Potato Men ' and not get so gratuitous in future . Although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office takings . :-)
The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel . ' The Cave ' is really a disappointing action movie . A team of cave and undersea researchers go to Romania ( one of these inexpensive places to make a movie , for now at least ) and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters . Or are they daemons ? The movie never decides if it wants to be action , science fiction , or horror , it is a mix of all without salt or fun , and acted in a wooden manner . The best thing about the movie is the cinematography , but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring , because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting . Waste of time .
If you're a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music , you're in great luck . This film is a documentary of current music in Istanbul , spanning the traditional to the modern . It's very good . You could not do better if you went to Istanbul yourself . We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay , concert clips of modern musical icons , a road show with a Romani ( Gypsy ) audience , Turkish Hip Hop ( surprisingly very very good ) , and much much more . Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard . A Kurdish woman singing in a hamam ( steam bath ) who will rip your heart out . Lots of social and political background . If this is your thing , you'll have a grand time . I could barely sit still in the theatre . < br / > < br / > CD soundtrack now available on amazon . Pricey .
This movie was fun ! Especially if your between 8 and 15 . Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it . Paul Giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to ' get ' . My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it . Parents : No really bad words or any sex to worry about . Recommend it for the ' right ' crowd . AP
Lauren Himmel's debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it . There's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name Treading Water . The storyline revolves around a Lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance . 7.5 / 10
Extremely entertaining mid - 1950 ' s western that packs a whole lot into just a 96 - minute running time . Most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable . More than just a B-Western but not really an epic , the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names . Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the time . Edward G . Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work , Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in " The Big Valley " . Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just starting out . < br / > < br / > Ford plays John Parrish , a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's ( Robinson ) hired gunman . Parrish is a former Confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons . < br / > < br / > Robinson plays Lee Wilkison , who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest , making good on a promise to his wife Martha ( Stanwyck ) . Lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier ; his brother Cole ( Keith ) has come up from Texas to help him run the huge spread . Lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between Stanwyck and Keith but sensitive daughter Judith ( Foster ) is understandably upset by what is going on in their home . < br / > < br / > John Parrish has promised his fiancée Caroline ( May Winn ) that he will move back east . Caroline , who is modeled on Grace Kelly's " High Noon " character , breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film . This leaves the way open for a John and Judith romance to develop . < br / > < br / > The violence starts early and continues throughout the film , with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination . He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film . Ford plays one of his standard characters ; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self - deprecating manner , who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked ( very much like his role in " The Sheepman " ) . < br / > < br / > Robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self . And he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character . < br / > < br / > Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman , a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother . In part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character . That said , a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations . < br / > < br / > Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise . She should remind viewers a lot of Carroll Baker , both physically and in acting style . Although required to play Judith according to 1950 ' s convention ( she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation ) , Foster shows a nice range . She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place . < br / > < br / > The real problem with " The Violent Men " is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play . Because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment . This is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film , but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline . < br / > < br / > Then again , what do I know ? I'm only a child .
I was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released . I had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts . It was THE hardest thing to sit through on earth . The show just crawls by , and you quickly begin wishing you were dead . The thing is , there are two types of Mormon films . The good ones with actual good stories , and the crappy ones that just plain stink . Saints and Soldiers , now there is a good movie . But , with these wannabe-comedies , the writers and the actors just try too hard . Basically , they try to be funny when they are not . No wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films ; they're filled with ' inside jokes ' that aren't funny to begin with , and they just try to poke fun at average things . It's the story that makes the movie , and the stories for these movies are just weak . I bet you can guess what my packet looked like when I was told to fill it out after the movie . ;)
Although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out , this is a total lie . In fact , apart from the opening segment , the film isn't even a horror movie . With its sunken treasure , legions of fish people , and mad scientists , it's a lot more like a Doug McClure adventure movie . Obviously , this film is no work of art , but it's kind of fun to watch ... Just be warned that the beginning is quite gory .
The plot of the movie is pretty simple : a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh-eating zombies . Those who left became " hunters " . < br / > < br / > Well , first of all , this IS NOT the worst zombie movie there is . Among the worst are " Zombiez " and the infamous " Zombie Lake " . < br / > < br / > In fact i think , the idea for " Quick and the Undead " was very good , just executed poorly . Considering the budget they had to work with , this movie looks very good . I wasn't bored at all while watching it . Special Effects were solid , although they did use CGI once ( fat zombie getting shot in the head ) , but everything else ( gore , guts ) was rather good . Acting is awful however . Our main guy looks like young Clint Eastwood , other " actors " are not even worth mentioning . As far as the plot goes , they didn't work enough on the development of the story . < br / > < br / > Bad : acting , low-budget . Good : special effects , idea for the movie . < br / > < br / > Overall , this flick deserves 4/10 from me . It's not as bad as people say . Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN , then watch this movie .
Look ... I've come to expect this level of acting from William Macy ... the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances ... but MEAT LOAF ? Just when did His Loafness decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of Stanislavsky ? Well ... what can I say ? I'm duly impressed . To paraphrase an old adage : " It ain't the meat , it's the emotion " ... and the Loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late .. < br / > < br / > Laura Dern carries off the 40 ' s look perfectly here ... great job by the costume and hair departments ... David Paymer is typecast but right on the money . Solid camera work throughout the flick . The plot line is reminiscent of " Gentleman's Agreement " ( post-WWII anti-semitism ) . Well worth your time ... particularly for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes . < br / > < br / >
Some TV programs continue into embarrassment ( my beloved ' X-Files ' comes to mind . ) I've been a fan of Dennis Farina since ' Crime Story , ' another late , lamented show . ' Buddy Faro ' never had a chance . The series had a good premise and great actors . It's really , really a shame .
2:37 succeeds admirably at showing us what Australian teenagers feel and don't say . These are the stories of real kids and I think we would be naive to think otherwise . The only new thing 2:37 really brings us is an Australian point of view . We often watch troubled American children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens . Executed with clever and artful cinematography , I did however ( upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song ) find the musical direction lacking in sophistication . I applaud the fabulous casting of this film . These are regular looking Aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this . Great performances all round and you can't top Gary Sweet , this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless you're squeamish , or you like to leave with warm and fuzzies , go and see 2:37 .
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival , we have titles from all over the world . China , Korea , Canada , USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears . Modern love ... thats for sure . < br / > < br / > In that movie by Alex Frayne , two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances . The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants . But episodes in Alex Frayne's pastorella can't be described as horror in the normal way . In fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more . In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric Australian film-making . Thus is the the case of Frayne . Always something new and fresh . Visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some Australian directors is astonishing good . Frayne's movie is super . There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in FRAYNE's Modern Love and in RAY Lawrence movies Lantana and Jindabyne . < br / > < br / > It seems it will be the same in future titles of Alex Frayne .
I saw this last night and voted it an " 8 " . Since then , it's grown on me and I'd give it a " 9 " . < br / > < br / > The film has ( at first ) a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves . The first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the ragged truths of eras , life , wars , religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half . While at first it may be a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence , on reflection it works . < br / > < br / > The acting was good ( Hultz in the role of Alex , the interpreter , was especially great ) . < br / > < br / > I've scanned most other " User Comments " and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not . Both feelings , of course , are valid . < br / > < br / > For me , a retired family therapist and one-world believer , the film was relevant on two different levels . < br / > < br / > The first , as history , gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen - - with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own . < br / > < br / > The second was that in demonstrating the first , it also revealed something in common to EACH of us , ALL our families - - that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves . < br / > < br / > T . S . Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his " Four Quartets " when he said : - - " We shall not cease from exploration / / And the end of all our exploring / / Will be to arrive where we started / / And know the place for the first time . " < br / > < br / > Jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating - - to explore and discover our roots ; what were those people going through then , who were they - - really ! - - before , when , and during the early years before and after we were born ? Etc . < br / > < br / > So the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy , then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies , but through all that it also gives us - - subliminally - - a message about each of ourselves . All of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started .
This story is about a safari in Africa that meets some guy named Trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes . Naturally , they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men . The rest is pretty predictable . < br / > < br / > This movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about Africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage , film of animals that are NOT native to the continent ( such as Orangutans , Moose , Coatamundis and Ground Hogs ) , a white actor in dark makeup playing a native , bad acting ( particularly from Trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood ) , comic relief ( sounding like Chico Marx ) , a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female Tarzans . By the look of it , my assumption is that the movie was made for under $ 49.95- - including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit ! But , what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9 . This is poor , but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high ! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't worth seeing--it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends . Just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film . < br / > < br / > Finally , here's a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic : < br / > < br / > " Oolama like strong white man . Oolama want strong white man ... " < br / > < br / > " oonga-bunga " < br / > < br / > " me-te-tonga ... no , ... keeel ( ' kill ' ) man "
Spawned by the same Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner partnership which produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased ) - the latter retitled My Partner the Ghost for the US market - Department S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the UK produced in bulk during the late 1960s . Like those two shows , its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality ( Dept S also has a black superior ) , but it's mostly facade : the launch episode , " Six Days " , is barely halfway through before Rosemary Nichols is called upon to parade around in bra , panties and one ( yes , one ) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation . Still , it's an interesting time capsule , even if the appalling fashion sense of Peter Wyngarde's character ( which , amazingly , degenerated even further in the spin-off series Jason King ) should definitely have remained buried .
Soon after this movie was released , Salman Khan was handed over a 6 Year Imprisonment . ( Read further to know why am i mentioning this . ) < br / > < br / > And i heaved a sigh of relief.Not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant No more Salman Khan movies , no more his histrionics and no more over hyped Acting ( read Overacting ) . < br / > < br / > This movie made no sense whatsoever . < br / > < br / > The scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated . According to the movie script it would chase anyone.But ultimately it finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested . Well this is what happened . < br / > < br / > The Rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an IQ of . 001 to believe that . Then it chases Salman Khan , who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience . ( In my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above , unless they are paid to do that . ) < br / > < br / > Another of breath taking , unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs . Later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and Katrina Kaif to katrina's Father and Bingo . Everything is fine and Govinda marries Kartina ... < br / > < br / > This made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my Money . < br / > < br / > This movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching . The plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing .. for ex Choota don ... What a waste of characters . < br / > < br / > After this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch Salman khan Movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an Oskar ... ( hahahah ... which means i would never watch )
When it comes to political movies I usually come out feeling empty . They generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of Batman movie . < br / > < br / > But with Lumumba it is the first movie I've seen that showed politics for what it is , and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence . There were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest . This is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something . Especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you , you cannot rule on what you want for a country , but what the country wants from you . < br / > < br / > That's why I disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad , I think they come of too idealistic , ( the Belgians want the perfect colony , Lumumba wants a perfect Unity Congo , Tshombe wants wealth and riches , America wants the perfect ally against communism , Russia wants the perfect aide for Communism ) . And the Congolese ? They come off used and abused , ( best example in the movie when Général Janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar ) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another . < br / > < br / > This movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country . Their intentions might be good ( or at least in the characters opinion ) , but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of Congo . I don't think anyone is bad in this film , I just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking . < br / > < br / > Overall , it's not just the best political film , it is a great film in general . Acting is fabulous ( Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting I really believe him ) script flawless , editing perfect pace , and production value higher than I expected for a central African film . A must watch .
It is the first time I can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book ... In fact , only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed ! < br / > < br / > Such as the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulty transmitting , um , communicating , LOL ! Or when Tidivinnus was played like a quasi-Sith Lord and got annoyed when the Roman Empire endured a blow , the general ordered for the Empire to .. ? Ah , watch the movie folks ! < br / > < br / > I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in French Cinema History and for my part it was worth it , Depardieux was excellent as the Roman bashing and Boar chomping Obelix . Clavier playing the little indomitable Gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of Jean Reno in " Just Visiting . " < br / > < br / > The fight-scene between Artifis and Edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the Matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battle ! < br / > < br / > Redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture , from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for Otis ' ( Edifis ' Assistant ) invention used at the very end . < br / > < br / > I understand there's Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same team back , by Toutatis , I plan to view that too !
The premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile . It is very poorly made but the idea was clever , if not entirely original . It's a shame the other aspects of the film weren't better . The acting is especially bad .
Let me state this right from the start . I do NOT hate this show . I actually quite like some aspects of it . In fact , when i first started to watch it , I quickly became hooked . I was just starting to come out of the whole " anime is for kids " stereotype , and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued . < br / > < br / > Unfortunately , after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films , I can say that my overall disposition has changed , and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague " bad " anime . Seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on TV . By the end , only one friend and I were still watching and neither of us liked it . < br / > < br / > Allow me to explain the plot for you . You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know . Kagome is an average high school student , who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine . When kagome comes out of the well again , she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan . She meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge / justice / groping in one characters case =) . Overall , they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it . < br / > < br / > While there are many , MANY side stories and story arcs , there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes . The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull ( the band of seven ) . After the half way mark in the series or maybe even before , it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes . < br / > < br / > These episodes have little to no impact on the story , and rarely even on the characters . In some cases , some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time . Many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it . Inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy . Windscar deflects . Characters gasp in horror . Enemy turns out to have barrier . Characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before Kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust . < br / > < br / > Also * * MAJOR SPOILER : THE CONCLUSION WILL BE REVEALED * * the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours . < br / > < br / > * * MAJOR SPOILER OVER * * < br / > < br / > The animation itself is above average , and in some cases excellent . Even so , reused animation cells plague most action scenes , and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row . < br / > < br / > On the brighter side however , all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating . Also , the character designs ( appearences ) were brilliant and at times among the best I have seen , particularly with the band of seven . There is definitely no shortage of Cosplay opportunities here . Even so , I found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot . And some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again . One particular joke ( sit boy ) is found within the first five episodes , and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes . < br / > < br / > Although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following , the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over Sesshomiru and InuYasha . < br / > < br / > Bottom line : Definitely worth checking out , but not worth watching the whole series . The first 30 episodes are very clever , original and enjoyable for anybody . But after that , it simply becomes dull and tedious . Watching a TV show should never feel like a chore , but somehow this series accomplishes just that . Don't expect much from " InuYasha " , because you will only feel let down .
This could have been a very good film , a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history , but it should have been a short subject . As it is , it moves at a snail's pace ; sure that's part of the life being portrayed , but this was unbearable . I fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight .
Target is the story of a special agent who , after carrying out orders to assassinate Turkish " Terrorists " ( note that this is one of those American " movies for guys who love mindless nationalistic super-patriotic crap movies " ) , returns home to find that his ex-wife and two kids are taking hostage . Charlie Snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back . < br / > < br / > This was by far one of THE worst movies I have ever seen . And , had it not been for someone I know actually ( and probably , mistakenly ) taking it out of the video store , I would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with . < br / > < br / > The movie plays out like any generic action movie story I have ever seen before . In fact , these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows , that is how bad it is . I half expected In Living the Color's ' Homey the Clown ' to Mad TV's Will Sasso doing his Steven Segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through , to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie , but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is . There were not even any good fighting or action sequences . By the way things are played out , you wouldn't even think that anyone was kidnapped , that there were any terrorists , or that anything remotely interesting was going on . < br / > < br / > Not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting , the acting is so terribly wooden . Just watch the part where Stephen Baldwin , as former special agent Charlie Snow , is talking to the kidnappers on the telephone . They tell him that they have his wife , and they put her on the phone . She says " Charlie , help ! " or something to that effect . And Baldwin replies " it's okay , honey " in such a deadpan manner , you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words phonetically . I imagine that , despite being such a ridiculously bad movie ( one that belongs on the bottom 100 on IMDb--a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every Stephen Baldwin movie ) , someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much . Someone . Anyone . I couldn't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script . Save that is , the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever ( and thus should not have been in this ) , Mad TV's Deborah Wilson . < br / > < br / > This was the capital cheese fest . How truly embarrassing .
Absolutely horrible movie . Not a bad plot concept , but executed horribly . Cliché storyline ; bad script . So schlocky it doesn't even qualify for campy . This is the kind of movie that gives sci-fi a bad name .
This film has a premise that is good enough to get anyone talking , and a sure-fire conversation starter . ' Would you sleep with someone you dislike or don't know for one million dollars ? ' While the film had lots of potential , poor execution turns it into a b-grade soap-opera . The film has a great lead up , and after the proposal is made , we are really into the film , but then it falls dramatically . The last 3 quarters of the film is spent by characters whinging , complaining and regretting what they have done ! The ending was so cliched it had me in tears ! This has a very similar premise to ' honeymoon in vegas ' which is far better . See that instead .
I was wandering through my local library , browsing VHS tapes , when I saw a movie that made my mouth drop--Waterbabies . I have been hoping to see this movie again--it's been over 22 years since I saw it ( cable-movie channel around 78-79 ) . I had recalled a good many of the details--Grimes in particular . My son , who is 4 , and I watched it . < br / > < br / > He agreed with me that Grimes was " Not nice " , and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love Tom . He accepted that . It was amazing that I still recalled some of the songs , too ! They had stuck in my head for 22 years--which means they had to have some memorable-ness , eh ? < br / > < br / > It's a good child's movie , with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not nobility / society in the time-frame . This is what all the children faced daily ( except for a few lucky ones ) , and while we try to Disney-coat movies , making them more pc for children these days , it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist--or even still doesn't . I enjoyed the animation . It wasn't Disney , no . I don't think Don Bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie . < br / > < br / > There's a lot going for it , though . David T plays two roles ! ( I really like him ! ) James M does too . The waterbabies themselves are cute . You feel sorry for Tom , and root for him . Then Billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role part she's playing--it's as if her eyes ARE magickal ! I'm a huge fan of WoO , TLW & TW , and company ( AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HP ! ) , and I filed this along with those kind of movies . Yes , he jumps in the water , but not because of suicide . He jumped because he trusted the lady in black--she'd been appearing to him all along . < br / > < br / > I think it's a good movie ! If you have kids , pick up a rental copy . If you happen to locate a buy-able copy , let me know where ! Ian liked it ! :) < br / > < br / > Dee
it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned . < br / > < br / > where do we come from , and where we are headed . < br / > < br / > the story starts with " the dawn of Man " , a documentary-like view of the Pre-historic grass-eater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat , and the lack of grass and water in the austral Africa . the monkeys hadn't survived if it wasn't for the " god-like " intervention of an alien artifact , that somehow transformed the apes that touched it , and gave them the ability to use tools , that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water . that ape was Man . an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film . < br / > < br / > after the fast-forward that leaves the movie at the present days , we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of Strauss . The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man . the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage : the starchild . < br / > < br / > at 1968 , the year this movie was released , only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space . after this movie , that changed . it's futurism took 7 years to be explored . the special effects are incredible . they are completely realistic , even today . < br / > < br / > the directing , along with excellent taste in music , good acting , and the fantastic filmography , makes it an epic . < br / > < br / > the plot , with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools , with an AI psycokiller , with the psycotropical hypnotising end , makes it the trip our lives . < br / > < br / > if you have never seen this movie , see it . don't be scared with the lack of dialog , sit back and enjoy . it's a symphony of evolution . it's terrific .
This is a joke , right ? This can't be a real film ? It's not even a real video ? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this . The film maker's can't be serious ... right ? Is this satire ? Comedy ? Drama gone horribly wrong ? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable . Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay . The dialogue isn't clichéd . Clichéd dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun - but it doesn't and it isn't . Worst of the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a " Honeymooners " episode . Whaaa ? ? ? I have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs . One of the leads is an attractive lunk , the other is not . Both can't even manage a convincing kiss . So much for romance . The supporting players are jaw-droppingly over-the-top . < br / > < br / > Everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet . Most of the dialogue is ( mercifully ) unintelligible . < br / > < br / > This stale cinematic fruitcake isn't even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay holiday installment of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 . It's just plain bad . In every way . VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will trample your every expectation . Have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbor's holiday lights - it will be time better spent .
The worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible . < br / > < br / > They had a nice budget , though so do many films ; they made it look slick and pretty , and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film ... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools , ( you know , the place all lesbian love lives and dies ) . < br / > < br / > This is a theme that has been done again and again and AGAIN in film , but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue - cannot seem to get enough of . < br / > < br / > Every element of this story was so over the top , excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through . The lead characters say it all : the crazy , abandoned , genius , rebel lesbian tough girl ( well , they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough her up , but it didn't stick much ) seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her . < br / > < br / > Watching them every step of the way is character 3 , a dopey , well-meaning , wide-eyed , good girl observer . I say ' every step ' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest , most inane monologues . < br / > < br / > Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old , though they are trying oh so , so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really , um , you know , well ... talk . " Hearing them ( make love ) with their noises was um , you know , like , well ... okay ! " she says about her 2 wanton roommates , who roll around in the bed next to her . < br / > < br / > Later she asks Graham Greene - the accomplished native American actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener ( ! ) " Is it wrong to care what people think ? " < br / > < br / > Sorry , but is she a teenager , or is she age 7 ? < br / > < br / > Granted , Piper Perabo ( as Polly the tortured dyke ) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter . Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera . She would do well in a decent project , so this is in no way a criticism of the acting . < br / > < br / > But this story is SHAMELESS in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character . They couldn't stop with her ( Polly ) being an angry , crazy-passionate , secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher . Oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of " gabbing " . < br / > < br / > " That's a word THEY ( males ) use against US ( women ) ! " she says , stomping out of the classroom . < br / > < br / > Is this ALL the writer could come up with ? Or maybe we should ask : Why stop there ? < br / > < br / > Poole and co . went on and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods . < br / > < br / > Cue the slow motion , sci-fi , Xena atmosphere ! < br / > < br / > Then we have her writing to her birth mother ... ( most lesbians are love-starved orphans , in case you were in the dark ) . < br / > < br / > Then we have two teachers ( one uptight , one a zany type with loose neck ties ) who hover around all of the action ( the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers ) ... and give dark child / seductress / bird girl tense looks . Hmmm . I wonder if something well , you know ... um , FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS ? ? ? < br / > < br / > There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done . Heartbreak happens , but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock . < br / > < br / > I cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end , but if you are not laughing , I can only guess you are crying . And not for the right reason . And I don't mean the wimpy make out scenes .
I saw this with high expectations . Come on , it is Akshay Kumar , Govinda , and Paresh Rawal , who are all amazing at their comedy , I was really hoping for a laugh riot . Sadly , that is not what I got at all ... < br / > < br / > Unfortunately , nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud . There were times when I chuckled at one or two things , but nothing really made me laugh . In short , it was badly attempted comedy , and in a way , a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe . < br / > < br / > Out of the three main guys , I think Paresh Rawal's role was the most powerful . It wasn't the biggest role , but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay . Their performances were okay I guess . Nothing special , just mediocre . Though Govinda stole the limelight from Akshay in more than a few scenes . Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film , and both of them were pretty bad . Lara's role did not move me , or make me laugh , and Tanushree Dutta's character just got on my nerves ! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag . My favourite song is " Tere Bin " , followed by " Afreen " , which I really liked . " Signal " and the title song " Bhagam Bhag " are also worth a listen . < br / > < br / > You either will like it or you won't . And judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction , I don't think you will .
I have always liked the Carry On films , with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy , but I can see why the critics give this one two stars . Basically , many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel . What they didn't know is that it is not completely built , plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours , they have crap draws , and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe ( Peter Butterworth , putting on quite an amusing accent , e . g . peace sounding like the bad P word ) . Starring Sid James as Vic Flange , Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar , Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle , Joan Sims as Cora Flange , Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins , Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt , an apparently crap ( I personally can't remember who he is ) Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway , June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt , Hattie Jacques as Floella ( a ridiculous hag character , not as memorable as her usual Matron ) , Bernard Bresslaw as Brother Bernard , Sally Geeson as Lily , Carol Hawkins as Marge , Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs . I admit it is not great , but there are just enough dialogue gags , and of course Babs in the shower , and going to to her bum with that iconic whistle , and later a rapid rip off of her bra . Okay !
Like an earlier commentor , I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story , splendid acting , and dramatic musical score . It certainly contains some of Sam Waterston's finest work . He and the writers depict Oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero - - which he was - - but also as naive , fond of alcohol , and snobbish , a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype .
One True Thing proves that it's the characters which make a movie . Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for her role . A beautiful drama , One True Thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990 ' s - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects . It's no Best Picture or anything ... don't be silly . But the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave . I cried twice in this movie , which says a lot for a 24 year old man .
Greetings ; < br / > < br / > I never thought I would see the day when I would be so disgusted by A movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I was always a fan of horror movies , B'C and C's included . But in this case it's hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale ... < br / > < br / > The movie is centered on a poorly developed back story , a mix of folklore with an after taste . And to top it up , the performance of the actors is questionable . Horror B movies usually fall in two categories ... 1 ) A gem that was under looked , and under funded 2 ) So bad it's funny , laugh or your money back . Well this movie falls in between . I wasn't scare , didn't laugh ... So I guess if you really need to see it you could but I recommend you don't ...
I really enjoyed this movie ... In My DVD collection of baseball movies ... Reminded me how great the sport truly is ... Whether it's here in America or Japan .
After The Funeral was absolutely superb , and by far the best episode of the season . I was disappointed with Cards On the Table , that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour , and I didn't know what to think of Taken After the Flood , though I do remember being confused at the end . After the Funeral as I've said is one of my all time favourite Poirot episodes , up there with Five Little Pigs , Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders . I was afraid that they would ruin the story , but instead it is very faithful to the book . Now I will say I don't mind changes to books , and try not to compare movies and TV adaptations to their sources , except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice . That's why I disliked some of the Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder , and so far out of the Poirots The Murder of Roger Ackroyd , Taken At the Flood and Cards on the Table are the only ones that really did disappoint . Everything else ranges from good to outstanding , even the recent Appointment with Death , despite the many deviations from the book , which I admit isn't a favourite , was surprisingly good , thanks to the marvellous production values , stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score . Back to After the Funeral , the production values are fantastic . It has a really cinematic feel to it , and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes . The music was very stirring and even haunting , and the entire cast give wonderful performances . David Suchet is impeccable as always as Poirot , and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as terrific . But for me , the standout was Monica Dolan as Mrs Gilchrist , she is up there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actor / actress in a Poirot episode , that's how good her performance was . All in all , a must see , one of the best Poirot episodes by far , and one of the more faithful ones too . 10/10 Bethany Cox
This movie really sucked ... HARD ! It was just stupid with a terrible ending . I love a really cheesy horror flick , but this was terrible ! The " trick " ending totally contradicts everything you've seen in the movie , if you last til the end . Take my advice and steer clear of that dirty old hag The Granny .
I did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988 . It was awful then and even worse now - I spotted it on VHS at the local HollowWood Video and said , " oh , what the hey , for auld ang sine " . Yech . < br / > < br / > They had to shoot most of it in Mexico after they ran out of money , a couple of the " stars " pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap . The movie's plot is OK , I suppose , but I happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughout . < br / > < br / > Dr O ended up being a cartoon character . He must still be whirling in his grave over in the Kremlin Wall . < br / > < br / > Technical errors were all over the movie , not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms , insignia , and military jargon . They were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser , of course . Even Mr . Newman's august and expert presence couldn't have saved this bird from being stuffed for Thanksgiving .
A film , first and foremost , should be good storytelling . It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean " laughs " , and it doesn't necessarily mean " light " . It basically means you're not bored while watching it . < br / > < br / > As brilliant as 2001 may be , it is a difficult film to watch , especially for the current ( video-game-playing / iPod fumbling ) generation . Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action ( e . g . the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space ) will stretch your patience . On the other hand , the cinematography is brilliant , the film cleverly directed , the ending thought-provoking and the score ... the score is chilling , especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon . Boy , I had goose bumps , big time . This doesn't happen often when I watch films , and is a testament to Kubrick's directing skills . < br / > < br / > It IS considered a classic , and many people consider it the best science-fiction film of all time . That alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet . However , just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it . You either will ( like it ) or you won't . Perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing , after all . Directing your attention to something rather static and slow-paced for 2 1/2 hours might teach you a lesson . It will certainly be a different experience to all these fast-moving , fast-paced images we are subjected to these days ( whether commercials , music videos or video games ) . < br / > < br / > I myself think it's a " memorable " film . But not one I'm eager to watch again anytime soon ( unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-paced films ) . < br / > < br / > Hence , 7 stars out of 10 from me .
* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) is back ... for a travesty of a movie ! Now he's in Italy , appreciating our food ( including people , such as Rinaldo Pazzi ( Giancarlo Giannini ) ) , but comes back to the States for Clarice ( Julianne Moore ) and to even the score with a former victim , Mason Verger ( Gary Oldman ) . < br / > < br / > Let me tell you , this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter , because it's truly , completely , absolutely , totally BAD . < br / > < br / > I mean , the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain sautéed ? WTF ? Then , why the HELL was everybody so annoying ( including Clarice ) ? And why did the story keep going nowhere ? I suppose that this is the ' teen ' chapter of the Hannibal series ; terrible , stupid , gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing . < br / > < br / > Don't watch it , especially if you love any other of the Hannibal movies ( SOTL , Manhunter , Red Dragon , Hannibal Rising ) . < br / > < br / > Hannibal : 1/10 .
Virtual Sexuality proves that Britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from America . The only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an American film would and a cameo by Ram John Holder , which is always welcome . That's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night .
What a shocker . For starters , I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . It didn't make me scared , horrified , or make me sympathetic towards the characters ; it was simply annoying . The jerky camera movements were also annoying . The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror . There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth , but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot . And then there's the ending . I'm still not really sure what to make of it . I guess it was supposed to be clever twist , then shed some light on the situation , but it was just stupid . < br / > < br / > The case had a couple of those little award winner / nominations symbols on it , so I figured it couldn't be too bad . I was wrong . If you see it , you should probably just leave it on the shelf .
The story and the characters really REALLY needed work . The world idea is kind of neat , but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition , or through the plot . Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film , it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition , since no one is new to this world . And yet , when Matt Owens ( Bill Paxton ) and Byron ( Bob Peck ) stray off-course and get lost , and get introduced to the wind-worshipers and the fat , lazy , rich people in the museum , we don't get any real idea of who these people are , or why we should care about any of them . Smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world . Simple things , like ordering a drink at a bar , or talking about something in the past - - these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable , not endless shots of crappy planes , and cheap CG effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralight . < br / > < br / > If this is too difficult for you , here's a little tip - - pare down the multiple locations . If everything's becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often , stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little . All the superfluous crap should be removed . Get rid of the entire wind-worshipers scene . Get rid of the stuffy museum people . Get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story . Have the entire thing set on a big plane , or something . Just get people talking about something we care about . < br / > < br / > Hey , get rid of Bill Paxton . Have the film center around Tasker's character and his relationship with the robot , Byron . < br / > < br / > Indeed , the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody , because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters . We don't like Matt ( well , because he's played by Bill Paxton , among other things ) . He's a scoundrel , who doesn't redeem himself enough , except to let the android , Byron , go . And this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points : < br / > < br / > 1 . Byron is a murderer . 2 . Byron is indestructible 3 . Byron can leave any time he damn well pleases . < br / > < br / > We try to like Byron , because there's a kind of pathos there , but it's largely undeveloped . All we're left with is a whiny , glassy-eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment , and practically zany the next . We don't know why or how he develops emotions , but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone . We don't know why he murdered someone , or the circumstances of this grisly event , because it isn't developed . We can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story . All we know for a fact is that he murders people . And he likes Bill Paxton . < br / > < br / > We don't hate Tasker enough ( partly because he's played by good-guy Mark Hamill ) , since while gruff and ruthless , doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character - - a post-apocalyptic peace officer . Sure he kills Montclaire ( Robbie Coltrane ) and his team , but they are drug dealers , on their way to grow poppies for heroin . And they shoot at him first . He doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way , or who does not try to physically harm him first . That goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum . He uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante ( F . Murray Abraham is wasted in this role ) , and everyone else draws a gun on him . < br / > < br / > I really don't understand what's the deal with Belitski ( Kitty Aldridge ) , Tasker's partner . After only an accumulated 10 minutes with Matt , she's ready to switch sides , despite her shouts of loyalty , and despite Matt's trash-talking her , and punching her out . If that's love , then I'll choose hate any day . < br / > < br / > Really . Paxton's character is about as lovable as Simon in " True Lies " , or Pvt . Hudson from " Aliens " . Does anyone fall for him in these movies ? No . Why ? Because he's a loud-mouthed idiot , and a loser . Why put him at the helm of this film ?
I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this . It seems to be divided into two parts - - action sequences and personal dramas ashore . It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school , guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner , then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place , the last resulting in death . < br / > < br / > I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted . A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen ( " puddle pirates " ) . The experienced old timer Costner who is , as an elderly bar tender tells him , " married to the Coast Guard . " The older chief who " keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen . " The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit . The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors , all in pursuit of a loftier goal . The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past . < br / > < br / > The problem is that we've seen it all before . If it's Kevin Costner here , it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr . or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere . And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from " The Perfect Storm " and " Dead Calm . " None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality . < br / > < br / > It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction . It's mostly personal conflict , romance , and tension about washing out . < br / > < br / > It's a shame because the U . S . Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit , its official mission being " the safety of lives and property at sea . " In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles . In World War II , the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks . < br / > < br / > But , again , we don't learn much about that . We don't really learn much about anything . The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else . A disappointment .
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time . Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film . < br / > < br / > Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy ? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids ? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings ? Does any of this matter when faced with the sheer sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters . Any battle for my heart was won once I saw the main protagonist dressed as spider-man - awesome ! Many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can't do better , especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says " I will love you 10,000 years " .
This movie has some good lines , but watching Dillon's less-than-masterful Rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original . I like Marisa Tomei but she's no Faye Dunaway . < br / > < br / > Also , in my opinion , the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about . You might not LOVE the character , but you should care what happens to him . This is achieved in Barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with Eddie the bartender . The main fight in Factotum is when , completely unprovoked , he stalks up to the Lily Taylor character in a bar , punches her to the floor and calls her a whore . < br / > < br / > The whole thing just didn't work . Again , some great lines - - some laugh-out-loud funny - - but as a movie overall it's a fail . Mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant , and you can't get past that . Next ? Let's remake Breakfast at Tiffany's with Kate Hudson .
I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties . Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time . A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw . < br / > < br / > I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted ! I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.Anyway , I just this film again on VHS cassette and this movie still holds up . A little slow at the beginning as I remembered when I first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace . One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look !
I saw this movie ( unfortunately ) because it was the only option at that time and because David Zucker was the director . I saw his previous " Naked gun " ( both parts ) , Airplane and Top secret ! , and I liked , at least I had a good time and laughed . I'm not saying that the movies I mentioned were master pieces , but were OK . I don't recall any other more stupid movie than this . It's incredible how Hollywood industry is in total decadence . If some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture , then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days . This is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people . I don't have any good to say about this film . If you are planning to rent it or buy it , please don't waste your money or your time , avoid it no matter what . Even if you are fan of one of the actors , does not worth it . In fact this could be a very good example of what a Director should avoid . I won't see a Zucker movie again . ( He is planning to direct the fourth sequel of Scary movie , imagine that ! ) . Pathetic . Awful .
This movie easily falls into the category of laughable , if not beyond that to actually insulting . I mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play ? From beginning to end we bombarded with Quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions , laying on the " im a loose cannon " act a little thick . Another picking point I had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character . I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top , just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of . Then Lewis begins to play his rendition of " A whole lot of shaking ' " and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world . These kind of scenes , of which there are numerous , coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter . So all in all this film is not worth viewing for anyone not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors decisions for an hour and a half .
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands . Can this honest , good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart , Miss Honey Bee , from the machinations of the evil C . Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late ? < br / > < br / > While not one of the great animated features ( a very new art at the time this film was created ) HOPPITY is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers . Technically it is well made , with animation of a generally high quality . The movie's main drawback is that none of the characters really have any ` heart ' - they don't come ` alive ' on the screen in the way Jiminy Cricket did a year earlier in PINOCCHIO . < br / > < br / > However , it is ultimately unfair to compare the Fleischer Studio output with that of Disney . Max & Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow ; their contribution - and it would be a considerable one - would be in the realm of the one-reel cartoon . With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series they created alternate realities as viable as any produced by other cartoon studios . HOPPITY was their second experiment with feature length animation ( after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939 ) , and henceforth they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject . In fact , the first in the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already in release . < br / > < br / > HOPPITY'S story owes a great deal to Frank Capra , with it's energetic , go get  em hero up against powerful societal forces . Indeed , the film's original title was MR . BUG GOES TO TOWN , which immediately puts one in mind of Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their Capraesque adventures . < br / > < br / > Jack Mercer , famous as the voice of Popeye , here speaks for two very different characters , old Mr . Bumble & Swat the Fly . Movie mavens should be able to catch veteran voice actors Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel , both in uncredited roles . < br / > < br / > The film has some pleasant songs supplied by Hoagy Carmichael & Frank Loesser , of which ` Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee ' is the most familiar . ` We're The Couple In The Castle ' is a fine romantic tune which deserves to be rediscovered . < br / > < br / > It is unfortunate that the film's initial animation , with its sweep out of the heavens and past the in-depth New York skyline , is obscured behind the opening credits .
This documentary is as unique as it's subject . And while D'Amato's staple was erotica , the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time , late night Cinemax ... One problem ... Joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica , even mixed in his gore films . The gore films are cult classics , going for like $ 20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net ( not peanuts for 20 year old films , folks . ) I want to see why those are cult classics . Also , as sweet as Joe seems ( he did seem more elegant than one might expect , ) the dude liked to shock . Both " Caligula : The Untold Story " and " Emanuelle in America " show us hardcore rape , snuff , and beastiality ( in both , you'd be suprised how far he goes in " Caligula II " with that one , if you can track down an uncut print . ) Although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career , hey , he did it ... Also , I would have liked to see more interviews of people Joe worked with ... Maybe that's just me wanting to see what Laura Gemser looks like these days ... I still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre .
Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one : he's co-screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish " epic " about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth . Potentially exciting story fails to take off , despite an eclectic cast . Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color , but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy . Good for a few stray laughs , but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong , solid adventure and campy nonsense . Later a popular TV series . * * from * * *
This movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny , I found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80 ' s movies that I have ever seen . I like most 80 ' s cheap horror movies but I would never rent this one again . It just did not make any sense . A family that lives in the woods invites their son , his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter - in - law do not get along well . We never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then , all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of ESP and the daughter - in - law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this " thing " that we have no clue as to what " it " looks like , all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies . Then when we finally find out what and who it is all I did was laugh . This " killer " turns out to be some kind of alien Japanese warrior from WW2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family . And all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of convulsion . This movie is pathetic ! Avoid it , it's not even worth renting .
Vidor shines as Judith , the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family . Her brother , David , is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes , rather than asking Dad to do it for him . < br / > < br / > Other reviewers have already outlined the plot , so I won't rehash it ; I will , however , point out that Nan , who is pregnant by David , is also married to him . This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy , which would have been horrific by 1921 standards . The two are secretly married , but Nan's father , having been paid by David's father , tears up their marriage certificate . < br / > < br / > Nan's death scene , with Judith in attendance , is a truly heart-rending experience , and highly charged with emotion . This scene alone is worth watching the movie for , but there's far more to the plot than that ; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story ?
My mom brought me this movie on a DVD . A guy in a rental recommended it . But in fact , this might be the worst movie I've ever seen . You know , I didn't expect much from this film , but it didn't have a good story , it wasn't even funny and it was senseless . I was looking forward to see Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved Step by step . Even she was a huge disappointment . The story was completely unreal . One of the party guys is dead ( he wasn't dead in fact , he woke up later ) , the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything . But then there comes a homosexual , policeman ... There is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes ? ? ? Come on , just be realistic at least . Waste of money . Really ...
The funniest movie from Britain I have ever seen , " The Supergrass " is a tale of sex , drugs , cream teas , and murder by the seaside . Dennis Carter ( Adrian Edmonson ) , average moron , is out to impress his so-called girlfriend , Andrea ( Dawn French ) , because she thinks he is too law-abiding . So , to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway , he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him . Trouble is , Dennis ' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring , and while telling her , a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him . And so begins this witty movie , full of slick comedy and crude jokes . Dennis is banged up in the local nick , and , much to the arresting officers ' delight , there seems to be no way out ( Andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of " Stand by Your Man " by the two officers ' ) . Then comes along Commander Robertson ( Ronald Allen ) , Chief Intelligence , Scotland Yard . He makes a deal with Dennis , that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers , then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases . Dennis agrees , and is teamed up with Harvey Duncan ( Peter Richardson ) , and Lesley Reynolds ( Jennifer Saunders ) . The rest is an unforgettable rib-tickling experience , with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding humourous colour to the film . His walk along the dry-dock against " Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes " is superb , and probably the best scene in motion picture history . The two officers ' who nick Dennis are wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin , and Alexei Sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh ! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night , then I suggest you rent this . You won't forget it !
I am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of ( Ray ) for the Sidney pottier of the 21st century ( Jamie Foxx ) who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in Hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of afro American actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of Ray Charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning Oscar prize as ( best actor for leading role ) an ( best mixing sound ) between fact and cinematic scenes upon Ray and Jamie as a mixing between two copies of Ray ( ray of the past ) and ( ray of 2004 acted in the person of Jamie Foxx ) . It was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatical scenes in the accidents of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in Hollywood since 1893 till now and his cleverness of choosing Sharon Warrne in the role of Ray , s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that Ray , s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as ( Nat king Cole , Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington ) and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from Gerogia and their decision to take his song ( Georgia on my mind ) the national anthem for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life .
There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's " The Merchant of Venice , " and there have been several television productions . But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now . Given the nature of the play / s most memorable character , Shylock the Nasty Jew , it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late 1930 ' s and 1940 ' s may have dampened filmmakers ' enthusiasm . Sure the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout , bray , brood , mutter , and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at . Like Richard III , the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream . It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite , since he never met a Jew . Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death ; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad . On some level , Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him . But , while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic , his play certainly is . Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish . Unfortunately , the result is a 16th - century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear . Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio ( Jeremy Irons ) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock ( Pacino ) , who's really just standing around , minding his own business . Will buy it when it comes out on DVD , for sure ! Sarge Booker
First , I should say that I've seen the ' 39 version at least 100 times ; know all the dialog , and have read the ' 36 play , which is different from the ' 39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own . This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery . There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it . According to Entertainment Weekly , Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other . GUESS WHAT ? ? ! That was Booth's intent . It was a slick , theatrical take on gossip , adultery , and back-biting among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites . The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material . They pick at it weirdly , putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version . Bette Midler ( who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad , grinning style ) doesn't have any context in this version . She mentions going after " Buck , " which is a key element in the original - - then he's never mentioned again . This movie is so dull that I'm not going to over-analyze it , but here are a few things that I found unbelievable : > Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff : " I can suck the nails out of a board ! " Right . Great writing . Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an Oscar nom , right ? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler ! ! ! ? ? ? Annette Bening got what she wanted , and the movie just sort of withers away . Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play . As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell , she was an ignorant , spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty , ridiculous , irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable . She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle . The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die . In killing her off , they killed the movie .
You know , as you get older , you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger , might have been because of your youth and inexperience . Case in point , when I saw The Godfather at age 14 , I thought it was boring . 20 years later , its an incredible movie to me . In other words , I grew up and began to appreciate great movies . < br / > < br / > So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request , as she loved it at age 14 and I hated it at the same age . But I hoped , because I was young and stupid at age 14 , perhaps this would be a new experience for me . So I sat down with her to watch , hoping to be enlightened . < br / > < br / > Well , the night after watching Dirty Dancing , I feel a violation . I feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest . < br / > < br / > First , Patrick Swayze plays a 20 year old , but he looks like he is 35 . And the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager , wooing her with his dance moves . Really Creepy . < br / > < br / > Anyway , the movie is the cliché plot where the " wrong side of the tracks " guy and the " rich smart girl " accidentally fall in love with each other . Of course , their romance is fueled by the fact the " rich girl " can't dance a lick , so the " poor hero " teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show , or something like that . < br / > < br / > But you guessed it : The disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other , and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making . This all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man . < br / > < br / > Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered . I didn't press her , but I did smirk a little , and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player .
Obsessed ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is , its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on , if you missed you missed it . And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks . I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T . V . shows of its time . Its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes . Also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is . < br / > < br / > And you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke to the immature Kirk the show is just amazing . I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them . There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls ... CLASSIC ! ! !
Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer ( Vargas ) . It looks very much like a TV movie , not really exciting . The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it . No real surprises here , though it is nice to see Vargas . Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie . Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts . The chase scenes are standard fare .
This is one of Crichton's best books . The characters of Karen Ross , Peter Elliot , Munro , and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting , complex , and fast-paced throughout this impressive novel . < br / > < br / > And about 99.8 percent of that got lost in the film . Seriously , the screenplay AND the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel . I can't fault the actors because frankly , they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Crichton's original work . I know good novels , especially those with a science fiction edge , are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original . But this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever . The book is really , really good . The movie is just dreadful .
Yes , I admire the independent spirit of it all , but it's like Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget . < br / > < br / > I chuckle when I watch American comedies , I don't laugh . This movie made me laugh , but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high-budget American high school / pot-flicks . < br / > < br / > If you want good independent American comedy with pot-references , go watch Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flicks or something . Don't waste your time on this piece of sh't movie . < br / > < br / > I mean , how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot ! < br / > < br / > And by the way : in Norway it's called " Dude , Where's My Pot " !
I really enjoyed North and South very much . I think it is one of the best and most lavish television series I have ever seen . The calibre of the cast is amazing , you have actors from " the golden age of cinema " , people like James Stewart , Gene Kelly , Elizabeth Taylor , Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80 ' s like Patrick Swayze , James Read , Jonathan Frakes , Genie Francis , Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down . < br / > < br / > At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men , there is Orry Main ( Patrick Swayze ) who is from the south and George Hazard ( James Read ) who is from the North . Throughout the series , their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds , particularly about the treatment of slaves in the South ( especially at Orry's plantation ) but when each needs the other , they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend . I really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war . < br / > < br / > I liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war , what was going on at the time , then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again . The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me . < br / > < br / > I think what is great about it , is it has so many elements running through it , romance , history , battles that would interest most of the audience , there is something for everyone . I particularly enjoyed the romance between Brett ( Genie Francis ) and Billy ( Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell ) especially when she stood up to her sister Ashton for the first time . The other romances were interesting as there were not all the same , each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the Madeline and Orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end . < br / > < br / > It is one of the best American mini series that I have watched , the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right . The characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe-tapping good and works with the mood of the story .
Pure crap , decent cinematography ... I liked some of colors . Other than that , this was one of the worst movies I ever saw . Boring , lifeless , not once did I find myself interested in any of the characters . I kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace . Nothing ever happened ! I think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot there was a movie being made at the time .
Okay , so this wasnt what I was expecting . I rented this film just to see how it would be since I want to see the first one anyway . But , this film had B-movie all over it . But when I watched it I realized that it was very funny . For the first 30 minutes It was just how the snowman was kiiling people and one man losing his sanity . But , those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it . When He throws up the first of his little minions I knew this would be very very funny . They all act like the gremlins in the ninteen eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a B-movie . So if you like to laugh rent this one .
Welcome to the Plan 9 From Outer Space of Star Trek movies . Come on , trekkers , admit it . This movie is so bad , so staggeringly inept in every department , it's become something of a classic . < br / > < br / > The Shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid . " BOONES ! Hi , Bones " Brilliant ! This isn't just Ham - it's several large pig farms in Kentucky ! < br / > < br / > The " Special " Effects . Should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term . The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film . Really ! Even the Star Trek TV show had better . < br / > < br / > Bones , Spock and The Shat sing ! Yeah , Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat . After struggling over the meaning of the words ! ! ! " Capt . Life is Not A Dream " Poor Leonard Nimoy , he must really want to strangle Shatner for this . Could The Shat not have given us his rendition of Mr . Tambourine Man , or harmonised with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins ? Sorely disappointed . < br / > < br / > A Sean Connery look-a-like plays Spock's half-brother . Only cos they couldn't get Sean Connery ! Uhura does a fan dance ! That would have been sexy in 1966 . In 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas Party . < br / > < br / > Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back ! Shat twirls her around a few times like a WWF Wrestler , and chucks her off . Yayy The Shat ! Seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel . Which explains why Spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t . v episodes and 4 movies . McCoy apparently mercy-killed his Dad , BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND A CURE . Tell me this isn't hysterically funny . < br / > < br / > The 11 deck Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft . Spock's antigrav boots amazingly support Bones and The Shat as well . Should also have used em on the humped-back whales in Star Trek IV ! Shatner meets God ! Or what purports to be God , but I assume is really some kind of alien being . God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments . Sean Connery the 2nd calls on God to share his pain , and promptly dies . Or something . God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity . So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo . I'd love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made of this scene . < br / > < br / > The Shat , having killed God , promptly goes back to his sing-song with Spock and Bones . Altogether now , Row Row Row Your Boat ...
I wish the series had not ended so soon . Although the acting may not be the greatest in the world , it does end on a positive note and does teach morals and values to the viewers . Hilary Swank did a good job of portraying a High School student who had lost her parents , etc . Miyagi was great as in the previous 3 ! ! If you are not into the happy ending , this movie , like the previous 3 in the series is not for you . This day in which we live you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys coming out on top . The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil . That is exactly what happens in this one . It is a great family movie . Please see it if you have not already .
i am amazed anyone likes this film . i never walk out of movies , but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster . the white characters are saints and the Asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story . they exist only as objects , surprise . characters of other races fare much better . the twists and turns were laughable and predictable . but if you're reading this , you know that already . Paul Haggis is a hack . Hollywood can't even do multicultural movies right . do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations , Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle !
Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.Not only scary , for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.The mob goon played by John Larch was terrifying.The only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a " little n - - - kid " . Those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on TV , maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.Accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the South and still till today the closest I've come to visiting a southern city is El Paso.That stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.When the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.With the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.The film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.The terror in the movie isn't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.Re killing of little girl : The recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.When this movie came out the only school I had ever gone to was attended by mostly African-Americans.The victim looked like a girl in my class , it was like seeing an actual killing.It made a horrible scene that much worse.Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me .
Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie . In my World History class , our teacher had us watch this movie and Amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something . We watched Amadeus first and it was a very good movie , but when she had us watch this movie directly after that , I couldn't believe what I was seeing . The acting was horrific , the costumes were ugly ( the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish ) , and the cinematography was z-grade . My Friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner . I understand this was a T . V . movie from Canada and probably cost $ 10 to make , but please , they could have done better . I have seen a few good T . V . movies in my time , but this was not one of them . The biggest thing that I don't understand is why my World History class couldn't just watch Immortal Beloved or something . How is it possible to compare composers when given the movie Amadeus , for Mozart , and Beethovan Lives Upstairs , for Beethovan ? It's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for Beethovan . I give Amadeus an A - ( 9 out of 10 ) if anyone cares to know , but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F ( 1 out of 10 ) .
A VERY un-Tom and Jerry short . Jerry narrates this tale that revolves around Tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival , Butch . Tom is best friends with Jerry here which irked me a bit . The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope . Overall I found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressing . The should have just put " Puss gets the boot " on the DVD instead and I would've been happy . This experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2 - DVD Spotlight Collection set . It's the last one on the set and I'm hoping that Warner Brothers chooses to release a second Volume soon . < br / > < br / > My Grade : C -
I've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it . And what do you know , I actually liked it ! It has a new twist of the 18th century england . Although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's clothers ( although it IS pretty ! ) , it fit quite perfectly . < br / > < br / > If you just want a good time , you should check this out . Very different from other 18th century detailed films .
When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought " god , this is horrible ! " But I loved Wet Hot American Summer . So I knew something didn't make sense . There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there . When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met , but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years . The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs . Not only did I laugh my ass off the first time I watched them but continued to laugh harder when I watched them over and over again . It's really a shame Comedy Central had the restrictions of cable television for the Stella series . It would have faired much better on HBO or Showtime . Their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture . Given even if it was on HBO I'm sure the " masses " would have voted it canceled in a season or less , but still it would have been fantastic . Needless to say I'm now in love with Stella and all it's individual members . Any Stella fan should check out David Wain's site with all his short films . They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself . So my hat goes off to Michael Showalter , Michael Ian Black , and David Wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with Stella . I hope to see much more of the troupe in the future .
This anime recounts the tale of the Battle for Mamodo King . Every 1,000 years , 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king ( in the original Japanese , the creatures are Mamono , which literally means magic / evil object ) . Each Mamado is paired with a Human partner , and given a magic spellbook . The Human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the Mamodo , and when a Mamodo is defeated , their spellbook is engulfed in flames ( alternately , a Mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly ) . After that the Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world . < br / > < br / > The titular character is Zatch ( Gash in Japan ) , a 6 - year old mamodo with electric powers . He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini , and 14 - year old genius . Zatch is initially reluctant to fight , but learning that some Mamodo are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong , he decided to fight to become a ' kind king ' . < br / > < br / > Zatch Bell has drawn comparison to Pokemon , but a better comparison is to Digimon . Like Digimon , the Mamodo and Human have a one to one , symbiotic relationship . Also unlike Pokemon , both shows have an actual plot . < br / > < br / > Zatch Bell features character growth and evolving relationships , and some fairly adult story lines ( like love vs racism ; slavery ; mind control ; etc . ) . It even has some decent plot twists and mysteries .
Why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down ? It is cute and funny ( exactly what it is meant to be ) . Madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an Oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow ! She was just doing what the character called for , and she did it well . I loved her in this movie ; it is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita . The soundtrack is excellent too . It is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80 ' s flick . To all the critics , just don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it . Madonna is a goddess ! ! !
The only good part of this movie was the ending . You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home . No no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended . As long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well . As for Chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth . As for going to see the movie wait for the rental or TV . Do not make the same mistake I did and pay 8.50
I had high hopes for this movie I even gave up a night of watching Stargate for this movie . I found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing . I might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version , as I have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years . I doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic , as the other one has . If you have not seen the 19546 version , you might like this one but , I seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one . This has some nifty special effects but that is not what I look for when telling a movie like the Ten Commandments . I was kind of looking to see how they told the story , and the writers did not do a good job with this one .
I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie . The acting was horrific ! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio . I will never look at them the same again . Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise . Everyone knows they never could act . Thankfully , only Dan attempted an accent . His accent was a disaster as expected . I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota . I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time . The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read .
Unfortunately , I've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87 - minute version twice , back in the 1950s . Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier , this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece , replete with sweeping tracking shots through , over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets . Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas , Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight . Reinforcing this imaginative visual style , is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors , including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio , some brilliantly bizarre , full-blooded characterizations . George Sanders gives a polished performance , whilst an eccentric millionairess ( who turns out to be a rival racketeer ) is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead . Also realizing the most from her role , Patricia Roc . The film was made , on locations in Spain , in 1949 .
This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details . Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem , it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children , 15 - year-old Lucina ( Michaela Mrvikova ) and little blond asthmatic Kuba ( Adam Misik ) . The poem is much in evidence , but the theme--it gets a little lost . < br / > < br / > Marcela ( Anna Geislerová ) , the Beauty , and Jarda ( Roman Luknár ) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left , it seems , but good sex , which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba , in front of the telly , must hold their ears against the noise . Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock . There's no good explanation precisely why , but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet . His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes ( Josef Abrham ) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns . Benes is a super-nice guy , but no fool . His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail . < br / > < br / > " Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel , / On whom she can rely , " begins the Graves poem . But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela , when he meets her at the police station . He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany , where he , though Prague-born , owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life . He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother , whom he allows to remain . Benes ' every gesture is benevolent , even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail . < br / > < br / > In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother , Zdena ( Jana Brejchova ) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband , the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka ( Jiri Schmitzer ) - - who , for the kids , starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies , proves to be the uncle from hell . Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point , and never quite lets it go . Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace . It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children . He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own , and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies . Improbable--perhaps implausible . Why should Benes like him ? But then , what is Benes's whole story ? About some things the film gives too much information and about others , not enough . < br / > < br / > Clearly the " good angel , " Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished , good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing . It's only at the end , when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants , he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over . < br / > < br / > Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena ( Jana Brejchova ) , and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch . But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck . < br / > < br / > The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza , first in a tiny scene , then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal . If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence ; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous . Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film ' Once , ' including the latter's theme song , " Falling . " They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from ' Once'--though this film came first . < br / > < br / > Hrebejk's people are arresting ; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm ; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand . The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side . But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary . The acting is fine , and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity , but the basic themes of love , sex , and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear . It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids . But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother ( Emília Vásáryová ) . How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from " India " purported to be from his dad , who's in prison ? When did that come about ? Interesting details , hastily pasted in . This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees .
I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some , but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous . Barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn't bad , especially for the young ones he entertains . I personally find this show to be very underrated period . Barney & Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut ( and nearly 21 years after the character's debut on home video ) , he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children . Maybe less so than in the early 90 ' s where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time , but he's still a classic . As a fan of Barney myself , I feel that I should defend him in a way that doesn't seem like spam . The way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic , but would you rather have them hearing about war ? Be thankful some one ( a costumed dinosaur , but still ) is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply . In this day and age , I feel that we rush our kids to grow up and Barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart . In addition , many of Barney's lessons on current episodes about plagiarism , being honest , and yes ... even death , could appeal to everyone , not just his target audience . Besides , our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are , and he helps them do that . In short , Barney may be annoying to some people and I completely understand why , but cut him some slack . All he and his friends ( along with HIT Entertainment , his production company ) are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills , but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life . If more people listened to their children's favorite character and viewed him through their eyes , maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and possibly life itself .
In the animated series : < br / > < br / > Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone . She was cruel , selfish , loving , unpredictable , witty , caustic , confident , sarcastic , lethal , untamable , ambiguous all at once . The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth . She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through . The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking . You could never tell what Aeon's motives were . Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist , because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship . < br / > < br / > In the movie : < br / > < br / > Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear . She was pretty , loving , vulnerable , easily tamable , emotional and very predictable . The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most . The plot was obvious and contrived . Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning . There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor , at least in terms of personal philosophies . The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides . < br / > < br / > The movie was a horrible disappointment to me . I felt betrayed . They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time , squeezed all the depth and personality out of her , and pumped her full of Hollywood clichés . The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie . < br / > < br / > The only reason I'm not giving this movie a " 1 " is because the visuals were incredible . It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI .
When at the very start of the film Paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family's house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller ; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around . But as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably . < br / > < br / > " Ordeal by Innocence " is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment . Nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity ( wether you guessed or not ) . < br / > < br / > Donald Sutherland , Cristopher Plummer , Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles ( far from her good performance in " Ryan's Daughter " ) just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either . < br / > < br / > You won't miss much if you skip this one .
This movie is an abortive , stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie . It fails at even this , since there's way too much " plot " , and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore . Seriously , the puppets are sweet , and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good . The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout , with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast / Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher . Not that you really care what he says , as only the curse words are distinct . Cinematographically , it's non-offensive , pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal ( just like the script ) . The fact that New Concorde used footage from the " Carnosaur " films IS offensive , and quite confusing . For shame , New Concorde . For shame . " Carnosaur " is one of my favorite terrible movies , and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable . See the " Carnosaur " films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem . < br / > < br / > I give it one star because I am so fond of the movies it steals from , and also because the scale doesn't have a zero .
Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker . < br / > < br / > Now , unfortunately , he not only makes terrible films , but puts his names to ones like this . < br / > < br / > A supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s , this plumbs new depths . < br / > < br / > Believe you me , I enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even I felt kind of sleazy watching this . To use a word I never thought I would , its msysoginistic ( you see , I can't even spell it . ) The plot ( in the vaguest sense of the term ) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones ' accent , the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of . < br / > < br / > This is just terrible . Shocking . It almost made me cry . In horror .
I come from Bangladesh , and here , C.C.Costigan is a goddess of awesome sex . All kidding aside , a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night , watching movies on the Encore : Action channel , when we came across a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks . There was RoboCop 2 ( not bad , ... not bad at all ) ... then Judge Dredd , ( Stalone almost ruins his career ) then a movie called Lethal Target . One would think the title " Lethal Target " could only be awarded to a really cool , and really cheesy Rambo knock-off . But nay , what is delivered is what I would like to call a " Semi-softcore , semi-pseudo action , semi-sci-fi film " ... actually , I think I can say that this isn't even a film at all . If it wasn't for the main character's sheer hotness , my friend and I would've turned off the movie as the opening credits rolled . < br / > < br / > I have a few questions to the people ( I wouldn't even dare say " professionals " ) who made this film . - One , In the future , why are they using the weaponry we used in 1999 ? Oh , wait , I get it , it's all that they could get their hands on , ... right ? ? ? ... well then , .. why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen shirt and a vest , kinda like what people wore in the late nineties ? ... oh ... I get it ... in space , it MUST have been a fashion statement ... well , then ... WHY , OH , WHY does the main character pull out a 3.5 floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can upload some bullshit ? ! wtf ! ? ... we've progressed so far that we have space travel , but we still haven't progressed past 1.44 megabytes of space .. ? < br / > < br / > I guess I'm just asking for too much . < br / > < br / > Question two , Let's just say ... that yes ... this is a softcore porn . Then why is there only ONE real sex scene , and why does it last for 2 minutes ? < br / > < br / > I mean , you're taking the REASON people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this crap ( dare I say ' movie ' anymore ? ) ... and whittling it down to 2 minutes . Hell , they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie , and they would've STILL made more money off of this " crap " than they did . < br / > < br / > C.C.Cortigan is hot . And no offense to the actress , but she acts about as well as I do . and I'm mentally retarded , and only have one testicle ... ( C . C . Cortigan , ... e-mail me ... we'll have lunch ) I would write more , but I've run out of space .
In the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like Vestron and Media effectively shut off Italian horror films for much of it's American audience . Coincidently ( ? ) Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability . < br / > < br / > Occasionally movies like Primal Rage , " sequels " like Beyond The Door III , Troll 2 , and a few Dario Argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased ( until DVD ) in the US for nearly a decade or longer . Movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans . < br / > < br / > Of these films , Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol , Fulci himself . < br / > < br / > Though not quite Fulci's best , it's still better than most of his later efforts . His rabid fan-base will probably love it . Italian horror and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it , depending on their tastes but I'm not sure about anyone else . People who only watch Hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here . < br / > < br / > One thing I personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably Benito Mussolini's only lasting contribution to Italy , Cinecitta Studios . The name is instantly recognizable to any fan of Italian movies . Until I saw it here , I could only imagine what it looked like .
Psycho criminal pure by Carl Schenkel , who is active in Hollywood , like Mrs Soutendijk . Goetz George and Hannes Jaenicke are stealing the spectator's last peace of snugness . They are too able , how can I get calm into a lift next time ?
WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life . This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland . Despite its near three-hour length , it does not drag for a minute . The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog . Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet . Also good are Wright as a love-sick young woman , Mayo as Andrews ' trampy wife , and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands . However , top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other .
I can't believe I actually bought this movie ! It sucks ! ... Where I live Mexican movies Mexican movies are never advertised , or even available ... you can't find them in the regular rental places ... so I had to buy it ... I really like Mexican movies ! They bring me closer to my roots , and my people , and they are way different that what your normally used to ... but this one was soo predictable ! ! ! Your could guess what was going to happen ... I'ts not a horrible movie ! It just wasn't worth what I paid for it ! jaja ... but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it .. but if you love Mexican movies , and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful ! lol
I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie . ( I'm not counting super bug budget , no storyline Batman's either ) < br / > < br / > A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist . The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection . < br / > < br / > If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie . It's basically a copy of that heroine . ( It even stars the same guy in both movies ) < br / > < br / > If you haven't , then let me explain ... a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance . She laces up the black outfit ( a sexy catwomanish , skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on Joan Severance ) and goes out to kick some booty . < br / > < br / > It's a fun , action packed movie , mind you , you may not wish the kids to see it ... without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene Severance has in it . Which in my opinion , was a bonus ( alright , give it an extra star <grin> )
In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of " Necessary Roughness . " Strangely enough , the voice she's using in this film isn't too far off from her real speaking voice . < br / > < br / > Anyway , the plot goes like this : Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father's fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa . She goes and investigates the site of her father's death , only to get sucked into a subterranean world that's part dystopian nightmare , part uninspiring fantasy , and inhabited by rejects from the Plasmatics . This movie really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge , who , in my opinion , could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her . Anyway , the main hero of the story , Gus , is a very lame Mark " Jacko " Jackson rip-off . The original is annoying enough to begin with , but this guy really is torture to watch . Eventually the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end . If you're going to have Kathy Ireland in a film in skimpy clothing , it'd better be a bikini . Anyway , the film was just all around bad and rightfully skewered by MST 3K . < br / > < br / > Avoid this one if possible .
Occasionally on talk shows a good topical debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience , unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person seeking acceptance who will end any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial " Everyone should get along and love each other " as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmation , as no one would dare disagree . < br / > < br / > Well they are the same people who marked this film as good , why did they do that ? INSECURITY . Anyway that's all I'll say on that matter . < br / > < br / > The Film , it starts of reasonably interestingly so you hope it will build , and if like me you've settled in with a nice couple of glasses of wine and some cheese then you will give it even more of a chance simply because you can't be bothered to move . < br / > < br / > But then you daydream , you wander , your mind drifts of onto other things , why ? because the Director did too ! he took his foot off the gas , and then he realized ' ooops ' so to compensate he accelerates hard , but then he drifts again , and again so do you , the story slows , the plot thins and almost disappears , you even wonder to yourself ' so what happened again ? ' as you ponder your screen will show Nick Nolte running around with some supposed purpose , but you will have long since cared as to what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background to your day dreaming . < br / > < br / > Michael Moriarty who plays John Converse has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or indeed his face , somewhat like a ventriloquist , he must have gone to the Nicolas Cage school of expressionless facial acting , or he was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector . < br / > < br / > Tuesday Weld was to play Marge Converse , but instead she played Mia Farrow to perfection . < br / > < br / > In all there are hundreds of thousands of films to see , so leave this one to one of the last , you see I've just wasted an evening watching it when I could have watched or done something else , learn by my mistake , nights off relaxing are precious so don't waste one watching this boring tale , do anything else , dust off that old game of Cluedo , practice gurning for the evening or have an argument with a loved one , trim your nose hair , get rid of unused files on our laptop , it will be time better spent what ever you should choose .
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island . They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants ; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife . < br / > < br / > The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie . The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background . The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way ; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic . It just seems to drag on and on . And even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point . As an example of 60 ' s Gothic horror , this is strictly a bargain basement example . I sadly can't recommend this one really .
While I have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the Russian Revolution , such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD , I did not particularly enjoy this one . This was mostly due to the annoying and " artsy " way that the director chose to shoot the film . While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style , this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse--in some places , the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish . Plus , and this was truly annoying , the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over-the-top . What I mean by " zombies " is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the Ukranian peasants were , the people stand like mannequins in many scenes . And , they stand like this , unmoving , for a VERY long period of time , while the " evil " Capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by . Gimme a break ! This movie is a wonderful example of style over substance--and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction . < br / > < br / > By the way , the DVD for this film is improved , somewhat , if you leave the audio commentary on . This makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights .
Considering the subject matter , I thought that this film would at least be enjoyable , if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece . I was wrong . I was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - I thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting . The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition .
I had been delighted to find that TCM was showing this , as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence , Jim Broadbent , Joan Plowright ... This film had a luminous Ann Harding , a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan , but others ' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film . Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him . I found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book . The original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete . Too bad it was such a let-down .
i have to rate this movie at a 10 . i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy . then , if you're rating it to other Madonna movies ... well , what ? you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever ? didn't Mira Sorvino win an Oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later ? please , this movie deserves much more credit than it gets . plus , i like to think of it as an A + sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80 ' s . remember when you could shoplift from Sam Goody and Cartier in the same day ? remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly ? so it was no " Last Emperor " , it was still good . there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday . three , actually , that pep up my day and make me smile . if you like " Who's That Girl ? " then i'd also recommend " Party Girl " and " Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion " .
As I write this , no user reviews are in yet , but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average , so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments . I didn't notice any , and even if I had I don't think I could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them . < br / > < br / > A common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science , police tactics , and the like so common in B movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment . I tend to fall into the " Yes , that's a reasonable reaction " camp - - especially when the mistakes are central to the plot . With this movie , I look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess . They completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy , police tactics , weapons , science , folklore , common sense , and human behavior ( outside of B movies , that is . ) In short , I can't think of any non-trivial thing they got right . < br / > < br / > Any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit , impervious to all small arms , able to disappear into another dimension at will , and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion . ( They don't make ghosts like they used to . ) Combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie .
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake , ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake . I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here . But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that . < br / > < br / > The first problem is the color . The original film was shot in black and white but , what few people realize is , the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented . The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern , but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's . Now , this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white , but the colors of this movie are all too wrong . The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green , particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character . The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and , when horrific events take place in these color schemes , it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream . < br / > < br / > The second problem is the lighting . This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting , but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction . Most of the scenes are very brightly lit , even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at NIGHT ! < br / > < br / > Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance . Yes , he does pull off Norman Bate's awkwardness and madness quite well , I don't deny him that . But there is one element to the character that he failed to show : the softness . There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character , at least at first , which then fades away once we realize the truth about him . Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates , this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS ! ! ! < br / > < br / > There are a few good aspects of this film . Some of the performances are great . As I said , Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates . Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original , which was a welcome change . Anne Heche may have been atrocious but , unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film , Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits . < br / > < br / > I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel . I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because , after seeing this film , that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen . There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original , and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax . So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way . Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow . Hitchcock covered these actors ' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances , not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose . < br / > < br / > In other words , my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said . Like everyone else here , I reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original .
I survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes , just to say I saw the end . If you want * real * mythology , flawlessly executed , look for Armand Assante's " The Odyssey . " Great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own . I only hope Sean Astin needed the money . And Sophocles and Ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be . < br / > < br / > At least with Sorbo's version , the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash , but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library . I'm surprised Halmi could turn out something so amusing ( the TV series ) , and follow it with something so devoid of quality .
I enjoyed this one , because I can relate to it . < br / > < br / > At one time in my life I was trying to make films , and experienced many of the same problems Mark Borchardt did in trying to make HIS film . And I also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed arrested development , where I refused to grow . But then , miraculously , I got married , and had kids . I realized that being a struggling filmmaker was , in all likelihood , not going to feed my family . So I got a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make that happen . That is what an mature , responsible adult does . < br / > < br / > Mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet , and so , in that sense , he is a retarded adolescent . For this reason , there is a hopelessness about him . Like Don Quixote , he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is . The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle . Mark has kids and an ex-wife and bills to pay , but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his " artistic vision " . < br / > < br / > Despite this , Mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual , surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends . Unfortunately , Mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career : maturity , responsibility , education , knowledge , life experience , prioritization , financial clout , etc .. Yet he trudges on , much like Ed Wood , apparently without any semblance of a clue . < br / > < br / > I guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the " never say die " attitude of this noble individual , struggling against the odds . And man , what odds there are ! Kiefer Sutherland , Colin Hanks , Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of big-time film or TV people ; no doubt , they will all want to direct some day , if they aren't already . How much room is there for an independent like Mark ? It's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board , over and over again . Come to think of it , that is pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors , with the kitchen cabinet door , in one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie . < br / > < br / > Despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms , I truly enjoyed this movie , and would heartily recommend it to anyone . Uncle Bill is amazing . I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and he told me that , in real life , these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie .
I just love this show.It ' s so funny and cool.Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character , I love him.He ' s the thing that makes this show what it is , although Kronk and Yzma are so funny and charming too.Everything about this show is great for me , because it always manages to make me laugh , no matter if it's only once an episode.It ' s just so funny and all the characters are so lovable and cool , it makes the show worth the time to watch , unlike some crap on Disney channel.Give this show a try next time it's on , if you've seen the movie , and even if you haven't seen the movie , you'll find this to be very enjoyable anyway , so go ahead .
STAR RATING : * * * Saturday Night * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br / > < br / > Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux ( Jean Claude Van Damme ) is re-assigned to Columbus , a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town . The culprits turn out to be ex-military , lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers ( Stephen Lord , otherwise known as Jase from East Enders ) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents . But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down , that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive . < br / > < br / > After Until Death , Van Damme appeared to be on a high , showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market . While that was a far more drama oriented film , with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking , no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed . It's nowhere near as bad as that film , but what I said still stands . < br / > < br / > A dull , predictable film , with very little in the way of any exciting action . What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes , trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo / sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate . Being a Mexican set film , director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez / Desperado sort of feel , but this only adds to the desperation . < br / > < br / > VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor , that can't be good . As the villain , Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon . He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end . All the supporting cast are equally bland , and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all . < br / > < br / > This is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock . *
Alright , we start in the office of a shrink , and apparently not a very good one . The main hero from the first Jack Frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about Jack Frost . Gee , alright my brother is yelling ' ' Turn it off ! ' ' . Anyway , back to the crappy movie . < br / > < br / > The shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff . I suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie , but he looks nothing like him ! . Yadda yadda yadda , they laugh at the poor sheriff , yadda yadda . Now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman , yadda yadda , now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people .. I don't quite see how this has to do anything , but their poking the anti-freeze / Evil killer mutant snowman with needles , heating it , shocking it , adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it , the whole nine yards . Nothing . Alright , they give up and leave it in a fish tank . One of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank . The janitor walks in , cleans stuff , bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes Jack alive . < br / > < br / > Behold the power of mocha ! Now somehow he is in .. uh .. i believe the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii .. But it couldn't be Hawaii ! Unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets . Bah .. I wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie , so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self ... Er ... i wouldn't suggest doing so though ... Sheesh ..
As much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance , I cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct-to-video grade-C porn movie in which either A ) the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or B ) the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts ( an amazing thing if it were true ) . < br / > < br / > I had to go back to Blockbuster to figure out why on earth I had rented it , which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs , which seemed to imply a seditious John Waters-style humor-fest with a sexual theme . Okay , I laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme ( although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way ) . But , on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly--on this one , you fast-forward because you already know what they're about to say . But there's nothing to fast-forward to , so just fast-forward past it on the shelf .
if u haven't seen Vijay in " Ghillli " , " Gilly " or " Ghillie " . go watch it . wow . its devastatingly hilarious . i don't know if Dharani ( the brilliant director ) was being serious or not . There are tons of hot guys in this one , look out for someone who calls Velu " Maacha " . The one with the brilliant braids , devastatingly hot . His teeth are brilliant as well . Vijay rocks . Trisha cries every 5 seconds . It is very deep . Watch it , you won't regret it . There are some great laughs in this one . If you don't speak Tamil , learn it . Then you will get all the inside jokes . It is one for the whole family , except maybe the violent bits should be skipped . I've seen this movie around eleven times ... and counting . < br / > < br / > Wow !
Without doubt , this is the worst movie I've ever seen . < br / > < br / > Poor acting . Poor script . Poor direction and poor production . < br / > < br / > Why did they even bother ? This entire movie was total nonsense . Suspension of disbelief can only carry so far , but this pushes the limits completely . < br / > < br / > For a movie with no humour content , the audience laughed disturbingly often ...
If you haven't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i've never seen another . Some very surreal scenes , some hilarious funny stuff , a film noir felling , musical numbers with a swing , sex scenes ( The 2nd best played orgasm on Film , bested only by Sally ) , a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art . As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end , at least not logical for everybody ;-) . I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back . But the film should be out on DVD in Austria on 10.06 . 03 and be sure , I will buy it .
This is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows , a certain Dixie Boy Johnson . Whether this person ever really existed I don't know , but considering the cast lists a certain " Lee Lasses White " and Roscoe Karns playing said character as well , I assume the man did exist and that this is a white-washed ( pardon the pun ) version of his career . The plot , such as it is , follows Dixie Boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth , his abandonment of the child to friends , and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation . Another forgotten man , Benny Fields , plays Dixie Boy . The man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen . Gladys George valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail . Judy Clark does the best impersonation of Betty Hutton I've ever seen although I believe she thought she was being herself . The scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved Oscar nom . Worth a look .
Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress , and I've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past , especially in the fantastic " She's the Man . " For that reason alone , " Sydney White " was a huge disappointment for me . The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters . In a good fun teen comedy , its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters . In " Sydney White , " this idea is thrown out the window . < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney , but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress . I blame this on the script , which makes her character too bland and restrained , and on the hair / makeup department , which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style . The seven " dorks " that Sydney eventually befriends are far worse . They are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters . They're essentially repulsive gag fodder . As is the story's " Prince Charming , " who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be . < br / > < br / > Perhaps the film's biggest star-to-be ( with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes ) is Sara Paxton , who's actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn . It's just a shame that the script-writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black . < br / > < br / > The plot is basically that of " Snow White . " What kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining . The connections to " Snow White " are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown . Prince Charming is unrealistically charming , the " witch " is far too despicably witchy , the seven " dorks " are too dorky , and Sydney is just too pure of heart . Now , this is not to say that the movie is all bad . Though Bynes is forced down by the script , she still has her moments . As does Sara Paxton , who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes . Sydney's room-mate , named " Dinky " is also great fun as a character . It's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichéd to recommend .
Screening as part of a series of funny shorts at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras film festival , this film was definitely a highlight . The script is great and the direction and acting was terrific . As another posting said , the actors ' comedic timing really made this film . Lots of fun .
For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 , but in general it only gets a 3 . The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do . The acting is very wooden , but at least they had a better " display " than some films in the shoestring budget category . It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement . The plot as a whole isn't the worst . It's a Resident Evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies . I would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another " super " zombie . I try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned ! ! SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! Not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug past the zombies ( the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them ) . But one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me . The deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil corporations payroll . He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess . The deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up ( meaning kill all the surviving witnesses ) no problem . But then 2 seconds later , he is helping them out . There was no real " change of heart " emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their savior . There was no incident or anything to make me buy into this . Worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks , otherwise you will not enjoy this .
Not even original in the plot . Ho hum . There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting , but the film follows the path of 90 % of Hollywood movies . I don't really " get " Samuel Jackson's acting most of the time in his other films , but he was rather good in this film . He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an " in your face anger . " I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy , she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress . Luis Guzman was actually really good also , except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film . How can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second ? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood ?
William H . Macy is terrific in this Alfred Hitchcock-esque film . Macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends . The characters that ensue are hilarious . James Cromwell gives a terrific performance as a blackmailing private detective . As always , Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance . See this movie whenever it is on t . v . and check your video stores because this is one you don't want to miss .
I just finished a double feature night of An American Werewolf in London & Paris . Let me start by saying " London " still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive , the film was funny , and scary , also a bit of gore ... Now lets get to " Paris " its enjoyable , a few scars , lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time , the transformations al'a CGI while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original . I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was enjoyable , I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott to be so silly that at first I wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it ... go figure ... Julie Delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse . I read here that John Landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't I am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether . I also noticed some discussion of a Sequel " What If " well no one has noted the Obvious it should be in American and here is my title " An American Werewolf Comes Home " or in DC that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare . You simply must see the original in it's new DVD transfer with dolby 5.1 sound and see both of these on an HDTV with upconvert turned on ... nice ! ! !
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time . Maybe I'm a bit masochistic ? Anyway , I'm glad I bought this one . Yes , it's all the same . No , it has nothing original . Yes , it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp , drink and have sex . Yes , they get killed one by one by a maniac . And you know what ? It's just magic ! It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie . The places where it's shot are so wonderful . You see mountains , waterfalls , rockies . It's just amazing . It takes a very long time ( except for the opening scene ) before the killer starts killing , but I didn't care ! It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care . What I mean is , you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself . The ending is a bit weird , but I won't tell you anything more about it . You'll know what I mean . Another thing I enjoyed : you care about the characters . They're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other . Sure , they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but , there's something special about them . Anyway , it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a pretty good time watching it because I really did !
I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer : This film has awesome animation , but has problems throughout the rest of the movie . < br / > < br / > Plot holes are huge , dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot--the MAIN PLOT POINTS aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film . The characters state the obvious , while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film . There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained--most of them have names that are only mentioned * once * , and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer . < br / > < br / > Don't waste your time with this movie . Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is .
wow is all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to Aaron carter is that i really think that you should be in a lot more movies cause you rock . i love Aaron carter so much hes hot and so i say thank you a lot for making this movie great . i really do so wish he would be able to make a lot more movies because he his a great dancer , actor , and singer . i so wish i could sing as good as he could . and I've been a fan of his for like ever and i will never ever stop loving him . i rented the movie and I've had it for two days and iv'e literally watched it over like 10 times . laugh out loud you could call me crazy but that just proves that i liked it a lot . if u wanna talk you can hit me up at dvlbab300@aol.com so e-mail me if you wanna . I LOVE YOU AARON CARTER ! ! !
I Feel the Niiight Heat ! I feel your HEEAAART-beat ! Something ain't right ! " Theme song written by B . J . Cook from Skylark - David Foster's old band and wife . She also wrote the memorable theme from CBC's " Airwaves . " OH Night Heat ! What a program ! Well-written , well-acted and totally classic . Crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end . I'd like to think this is really what detectives do / did . Giambone was a real favourite ! On a Canadian tip , I learned EVERY Canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on Night Heat . Everyone passed through the Night Heat set and like Law & Order , it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama .
I was expecting " Born to Kill " to be an exciting , high-tension film noir . Instead , it's got two good action set-pieces ( one at the beginning and one at the end ) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse ( usually a " glamor " cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir ) , but the rest of the film is pretty boring . Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance , mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after " Dillinger " ( an overrated movie but at least better than this ) . Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal , and the action ( such as it is ) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in San Francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling . It's one of those movies in which the supporting players - - notably Elisha Cook , Jr . ( whose character's homoerotic itch for Tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script ) and Isabel Jewell - - out-act the leads . It also doesn't help that , nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in " Psycho , " Tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have " PSYCHO " tattooed on his forehead . Also , there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called " Deadlier than the Male " - - but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film . " Born to Kill " is a real disappointment from Robert Wise , who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career .
No doubt about it , Rampling is gorgeous - - a classic beauty , here very young . She manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant . Her two male foils act well too . But seen in 2003 , the flic is all < br / > < br / > American-trying-to-be-artsy-and-not-be-Hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-sh ots-of-the-French-Riviera-and-three-pretty-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ca r . I enjoyed the view ( both the actors and the nature ) but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite .
Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy need only look to " The Bells of St . Mary's " . OK , so she's a nun with TB who's probably in love with Fr . O'Malley , ( think what Luis Bunuel could have done with that ) , but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often . In " Cactus Flower " she's a starched dentist's nurse , ( Walter Matthau is the dentist ) , in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up . When she's forced to act as his ' wife ' in order to hoodwink his mistress , ( don't ask ) , she lets loose and the buttons pop . And she's a joy to behold . < br / > < br / > The movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a Broadway hit , ( you can see it's three acts ) . It's a French Farce , ( it was originally ; it's taken from the play ' Fleur de Cactas ' by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy ) , and it hits all the right spots . Matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer , as she was then , called Goldie Hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for ' the wife ' even though ' the wife ' is having a ball . Hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress .
I watched this movie only because I was under the impression that I was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick . I mean , look at the tag line : " They're men turned inside out ! And worse ... they're still alive ! " Does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you ? And the then there's the title itself - - " Screamers . " What a perfectly apt title for a horror movie , I thought ! Unfortunately , I wasn't aware that the real title was , properly translated , " The Island of the Fishmen . " < br / > < br / > So , about an hour into watching this I realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all - - it was a cheesy " adventure " story about slimy fish-men from Atlantis . " Men turned inside out " ? No . There was nothing of the sort . I was grossly disappointed . < br / > < br / > Damn you , misleading taglines ! I want those 81 minutes of my life back !
This is a masterful piece of film-making , with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian , self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship , lust and love , dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns , jealousy , rivalry , cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more . A mature , subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances ( apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to , though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it ) . But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment , with inventive and elegant use of close-up , camera angle and lighting , including pointillistic faux home movie footage , is a wonder and joy to behold . It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci , but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work . A very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative , superficial shortcuts .
This movie was disturbing , not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled . The extremely overweight mother ( Angela ) did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did . This is not fair but is a statement in itself . I also notice her picture is missing from IMDb ( maybe her own choice ) and it looks like this is her only film ever ? The language in this movie was crude beyond necessity . Watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated PG in Canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful & disgusting . Never did appreciate Shirley Maclain like so many others seem to . < br / > < br / > LOVE Kathy Bates and always will . Sinese's part was annoying . < br / > < br / > The little boy Alex is a great little actor . I'll have to see what else he's been up to lately ..
This has to be one of , if not THE greatest Mob / Crime films of all time . Every thing about this movie is great , the acting in this film is of true quality ; Master P's acting skills make you actually believe he is Italian ! The cinematography is excellent too , probably the best ever . This movie was great ; and I have the brain capacity of an earth worm .
The problem with this - and with all Vietnam War films - is that they're all too biased . Antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of U . S . soldiers were heroes , while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie . This film sucks . It's time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar , nor liberal nor conservative , but COMPLETELY UNBIASED .
Talk about false advertising ! What was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place ? I think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie . I can appreciate black comedy , but this had only the blackness without any comedy . The movie was generally disturbing and un-funny . Yes , Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was also good , but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for Guy ( Whaley ) to lose his mind so badly . The ending was disappointing as well . What would Buddy's motivation be for letting Guy get away with what he did ? This isn't really explained AT ALL . Why would Buddy go for such a plan ? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy to screw Guy completely by turning him over to the police ? The ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how I looked at it . < br / > < br / > Generally , I disliked the film despite the good acting . Spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film , but towards the end he gives Buddy a bit of needed humanity . The story just wasn't as good as the cast .
HOOT is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of burrowing owls . now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong . in this film a kid name Roy Eberhardt ( Logan lerman ) moved from Montana to Florida . and once he gets on the bus a bully name Dana Matherson starts bullying him finally the next day Roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy . after all that Roy finally meets the Running boy who's name is Mullet Fingers ( Cody linley ) well actually his nickname his step-sister Beatrice ( Brie Larson ) gave it to him because he can catch Mullets with his bare hands . anyway Mullet Fingers and Roy becomes friends and they join together with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant . Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism's that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site . so they stood up to the muckle that was driving the bulldozer and everybody got to see the owls it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong . thats what is great about this movie . it teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is .
This is a great horror movie . Great Plot . And a person with a fear of midgets will definately love the evil midget ! This is a must see for any horror fan . Finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast ! Highly recommended .
Alright , the first time I seen " Talk Radio " was in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS believe it or not , and I looked at it and I thought it might be about Howard Stern , because I just looked at it for about thirty seconds , then just didn't see it again . Then I went to another store about a month later and I found " Talk Radio " on DVD for only $ 5.00 . So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone , and I picked it up . So after the film was over I was speechless . I have never seen such a film like this . Here's the main plot , then i'll tell ya what I thought of it . < br / > < br / > It is about a Dallas talk radio host Barry Champlain , a Jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he interupts , and is taking everything seriously . Now , a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the U . S . So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like Chet ( a neo-natzi ) , Kent ( a rock n roll drugged kid ) , John ( rapist ) , and others . Now some of the callers sound like the same actor / actresses . But still I think it fits okay . < br / > < br / > Now what I love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station . The dark music in the background fits very nicely too . It has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio , which I think they did good on . < br / > < br / > But the great thing about the film is ending . I was surprised by it , and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful . It also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like Dallas . One of Oliver Stone's underrated / weakest films mentioned , but I think it's his best in my opinion . < br / > < br / > But definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background . I still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored , as matter fact I watched it tonight . Yeah , if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film , watch it at nightime with the lights off . I may sound crazy , but it makes the film better ! < br / > < br / > Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title . ' Talk Radio . ' It doesn't sound very tricky or anything , it's kind of plain . A better title like the book " Talked To Death " or maybe " The Abusive Radio Host " or something catchy and not plain " Talk Radio " . Or maybe because of Universal Pictures ? Oliver Stone usually didn't do Universal I don't think . Paramount might have been a good company . I don't know , something about this film didn't do so well , but I love it . < br / > < br / > " Sticks and stones can break your bones , but words can cause permanent damage . "
this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better . holmes is protecting an inventor in switzerland and is on the trail of professor moriarity , who has become a nazi . this is a better version of holmes in a WWII world . rathbone does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective . see this if you liked the voice of terror .
After reading the reviews I decided to rent the DVD version . < br / > < br / > I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach . < br / > < br / > I was disappointed . I guess I do not know enough about Bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played . < br / > < br / > Maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in Bach's music that can explain the film . < br / > < br / > I really tried and saw the whole film hopping that I would be able to enjoy at least some of it , but I did not . < br / > < br / > See it at your own risk .
I had high hopes for this film , even though I had not read the book . Richard Gere and Diane Lane together--should be good already . But the film does not deliver on the promise . I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't . I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love . That can happen . But we never really get to know the characters . I would have liked more focus on them . The film reminded me in places of Bridges of Madison County , and that film was far better . I really felt for the characters in that film , and there was a chemistry ( much more passion ) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasn't between Gere and Lane . Each of them are very good actors in his or her own right . Simply not the right movie for them together .
When I saw this movie at age 6 , it was in the CHILDRENS ' section at Erols Video because it was animation . We watched it and it was a whole different ball game ! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY entertaining and compelling , but not for children . Avoid for family viewing , my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart !
this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen . the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks . seriously , if you have little kids don't let them see this . of course i am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets . also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne troyer . and some gratuitous nudity , a must in any low budget horror movie . all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book .
And I would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven Irish accent of Barbara Hershey in the leading role of Mother Madalyn . The accent came and went unfortunately which I found more than a little distracting . < br / > < br / > However , the performance of William L Petersen in the role of Joad was outstanding , he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue . Captivating and genuine , I found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character . < br / > < br / > The premise of the film is fairly simple , the building of a forgotten staircase in a church . It is based , rather loosely I believe , on a true story and I had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie . < br / > < br / > It was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time - a floating double helix made without nails or screws . It exists to this day although it is now in private ownership . < br / > < br / > * * Minor Spoiler * * Good supporting cast and Barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint . Lots of special moments . < br / > < br / > 7/10
Meh , Sums it all up for me really . Boring story , bland dialogue , dull action scenes ( HOW do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring ? Do you actually have to TRY to do that ? ) , no real characters etc . Just dull . Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work , when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to . Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action , fights , shootouts , etc . How can it be that hard to handle ? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care . There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing . Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades , Passenger 57 , Rising Sun , New Jack City , Demolition Man etc ? Awesome , intense performances complemented by decent ( if not always outstanding ) scripts , good supporting casts and wicked action . < br / > < br / > None of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame . The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover , knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years . < br / > < br / > I'd love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production , and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there . Together they would all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing . < br / > < br / > Detonator sucks . It's not as bad as The Marksman , which chews , but it still really sucks .
Watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously , the novel written by Dean R . Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way . The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers , the one difference is the main character Travis . In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager . Watchers has it's good points , the film does have some gory scenes in parts . I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film , he always does a great performance in all his films . The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film . The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained . < br / > < br / > The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab , a dog and a monster . Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them . The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein , meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes , two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand . Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way , so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents . They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind . < br / > < br / > Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R . Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80 ' s horror flick , some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80 ' s horror movies may want to check this out .
This movie is so God-awful that it was literally a chore to watch . I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room , but kept thinking ( foolishly ) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right . " You lose , we win , yay ! " This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Jackie Mason was funny . After that , beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks . And if you're even considering renting this turd ( or worse yet , have ! ) I have one thing to ask of you : didn't you even look at the cover ? I mean , with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is ! " Oy vey ! " This movie sucked .
Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director's decent into madness . The director in question is Fulci himself , who stars in the film . Fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as ' the godfather of gore ' , and for good reason , as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen ; from the eyeball violence in films like ' Zombi 2 ' , to a man been hacked to death with chains in ' The Beyond ' , all the way to the full on gore fest known as ' The New York Ripper ' ; if you want gore ( and let's face it , who doesn't ) , Fulci is your man . However , all this catering for gorehounds like you and I has taken its toll on Fulci's mental state , and he's quickly delving into madness , brought about by what he films . Fulci's problems don't end at his mental state either , as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby , using Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders ! < br / > < br / > I've got to say , the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious . There is one scene in particular that involves a hooker , and it's only fit to be laughed at , for both it's acting and it's stupidity . Fulci takes the lead role of the film ( obviously ) . He's not an actor , and it shows , but his performance is actually the best in the film . It's even safe to say that one the whole , the acting is bad for an Italian horror film . Of course , nobody goes into an Italian horror expecting good acting , so it's somewhat forgivable , but I do think that Fulci could have hired some better ones . Bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either . However , something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore , and it's extreme to say the least ! People get their heads cut off , a woman is slain in the shower ( and unlike Psycho , here we REALLY see it ) , people are hacked up , fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon - the chainsaw on display , which delighted me no end . The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time , which gives the film something of a ' spoof ' feel , but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway . < br / > < br / > It would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head , and Fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie . His name is mentioned often , and he's on screen nearly all the time ; it's not too much unlike ' New Nightmare ' in the ego stakes , but it's obvious he had a good time making this , and I for one had fun watching it , so we can forgive him a little egotism . The film's ending lets it down - I saw it coming a mile off , but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route , but I was wrong ; it did , unfortunately . The ending left me cold , and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes . However , despite it's ending and terrible acting , Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts no end , and it is therefore recommended .
The major flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker is within it's script . For the first half hour it's an okay effort , building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread . We even get some nice killings too ! Then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of " your basic slasher clichés " . I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more . The final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent . It should have been so much better ( although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay ) ! < br / > < br / > First of all , we have the dialog . It's awful most of the time ( there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it ) and merely adequate elsewhere . It is also barely audible during a lot of scenes , drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack ( however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to ! ) . There is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the " I know what you did last summer " - movies , indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke , but I doubt it . < br / > < br / > And the ending ... well , some will hate it , others will dig it . For me , it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere ! If the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status , I might have thought otherwise . It also throws all logic out of the window , because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills ! But as an avid horror fan I have learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian movies . < br / > < br / > But all is not bad . The movie has a big budget appearance , mainly due to the excellent cinematography ( the scenes from past times really shines here ) , tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack . Even though most of the actors are pretty bad , Anita Briem is an exception , making the most of what she has to work with . Real screen presence ! < br / > < br / > And , like I mentioned before , the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water ( but the " water theme " tends to get tiresome in the end though ) . < br / > < br / > So , to end this review , it's a movie that is quite fun in a " so-bad-it's-good " kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye . But don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will , judging from trailer and plot descriptions .
The creepy demons " The Gentlemen " capture the voice of the population of Sunnydale , to steal human hearts without scream . Giles find that in accordance with a legend , if a lady screams , the creatures will be destroyed , but Buffy and her friends , including Riley , have to fight the monsters speechless . < br / > < br / > " Hush " is certainly the best episode of the Fourth Season of Buffy up to this moment . Having lots of humor and funny situations , I liked a lot . Spike is hilarious , the romance between Xander and Anya is cool , but I loved the " intense " dialog between Buffy and Riley in end . The Gothic scenario of the final battle against " The Gentlemen " recalls the environment of " Dark City " . My vote is ten . < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ): " Silêncio " ( " Silence " )
This movie has a " big production " feel that I was not expecting from an independent film . The characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story , but left me with a satisfied viewing experience .
Typical story of an evil kid going after people . I suspect that Antonio Fargas ( Huggy Bear on " Starsky and Hutch " ) and Vincent Schiavelli didn't want to stress this junk on their resumes ( actually , Schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume ) . Sometimes I wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month ( note : that comment is not to be taken seriously ; I just think that slashers have lost their touch ) . < br / > < br / > Anyway , this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid . It's ninety minutes to two hours that I'll never get back .
My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up : this film was far more horrible than horrifying . < br / > < br / > This is the worst film I have seen in as long as I can remember . My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version . The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off . The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious . < br / > < br / > But as the film wore on , we were benumbed by clumsy acting - - both over - and under-acting - - non-continuity in directing and editing , trite writing , and crude special effects . We gave up after a half-hour or less ; after starting this badly , it couldn't possibly get better . < br / > < br / > Since I despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics , here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments , even if they amount to spoilers : < br / > < br / > - The lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother , the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business . The son asks , quietly worried , " will I ever see you again ? " Perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition , but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation . < br / > < br / > - A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater . A crowd of people stands nearby , peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused . One woman finally says " it's gi-normous ! " < br / > < br / > - After this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants , the lead and a bystander , now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape , have an exchange something like this , in a quietly puzzled tone : < br / > < br / > " What was that thing , anyway ? " " I dunno ... " < br / > < br / > - A crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military , since part of the bridge is destroyed . When an alien ship shoots an explosive at it , the crowd starts to run away , seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger , let alone unusual circumstances . < br / > < br / > And so forth ... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it . But please , PLEASE , save yourself the bother , even if your morbid curiosity is piqued ! The film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor ( versus , say , King Vidor's " Solomon & Sheeba " starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig ) . Life is too short to waste watching such nonsense . There MUST be something more productive and enjoyable to do , like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage .
It is a wonderful film about people . Strange people . The characters in the movie all have a very tragic past , so they all have their problems . Their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd ; but that does not make the movie worse , only better , for it is shot in a kind of fantasy-like way , so nothing is real . This review might sound a little weird , but then again , the movie is not quite normal ... It is also a hilarious movie at many times . If you have not seen it , see it . Enjoy !
The main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional Midwick College , which Peter Kendricks ( Peter Lind Hayes ) attends due to the largesse of stage actress Grace Hayes , his real-life mother who fills the same role here , and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary Mary ( Healy ) who is his real-life wife . Drably directed from a weak script , and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing , this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs , including the title number , and has nice turns by soprano Healy , Benny Rubin as a snack shop proprietor , and the dynamic tap dancing Roland Dupree .
Ok , maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy / western movies . But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had . Obviously , whenever you want to produce a story such as this one , focusing on African American historical involvement ( and NO , servants and ' mammies ' are not historical involvement ) , Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive . And believe me they weren't . The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of ' out of pocket ' expenses to make " Posse " , just so that the story could be told . I think that alone is commendable . Posse may not be Oscar material ( and they don't like Black media too much either ) , but it is a start . It is entertaining , and it introduces us to the black cowboy , a character most of us are unfamiliar with .
I have some great memories watching " Robin of Sherwood " on TV as a kid ( but I think I only saw Michael Praed ´ s episodes , by some reason ) . And recently my brother bought the new released DVD-boxes of the complete series . It was great to see it again , and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV-series . The cast is great , and the locations mixed with Clannad ´ s music adds this very special feeling . I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins , but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with . Ray Winstone , Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie is terrific in their roles as Will Scarlet , The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne . It ´ s a pity that a fourth season never got made , and I ´ ve also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series . Robert of Huntingdon ( Connery ) could finally have married Marion ( Judi Trott ) , or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley ( Praed ) , and he could take his revenge against the sheriff . As have been mentioned before ; if the producers of " Robin Hood : The Prince of Thieves " would have been smart , they would have got the cast from " Robin of Sherwood " , and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series . As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial , it would have been great to see them as old men , just like in Sean Connery ´ s " Robin and Marian " . Who knows , maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future . In any case , we can now watch our favorite series over and over again !
" Escanaba in da Moonlight " is the first showcasing of Jeff Daniels writing and directing talents . < br / > < br / > I've seen worse debuts but this one isn't that great . < br / > < br / > " Escanaba in da Moonlight " starts off like as a decent parody of this part of American culture . As we follow Rebuen Soady ( Jeff Daniels ) on the eve of deer hunting season 1989 . He is getting close to the record of oldest Soady to never bag a buck . < br / > < br / > The film takes places in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal cliche characters . But there is a warmth there that tells you , this isn't being mean spirited . < br / > < br / > Well , Reuben is heading off to The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife ( Kimberly Norris Guerrero ) gives him a Native American necklace , his lucky hat , and two-forms of liquid you probably don't want to know about . < br / > < br / > Anyway , she is really the only one who believe in him . He finally gets to the camp where his Dad , Albery Soady ( Harve Presnell ) is waiting and his brother Remnar ( Joey Albright ) is soon to show . < br / > < br / > Okay , let's fast forward this . In here there are some laughs , a few moments when I chuckled a loud . But most of the jokes here are used a few to many times . < br / > < br / > But the biggest draw back is the spiritual / Native American happenings . Just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur . But the special effects are so cheap all it is , is a big flash of light and then head quickly bobbing back in forth . < br / > < br / > And the ending , well it is worthless . < br / > < br / > The move itself wasn't bad , the quirky character , and fun parody were good . But it should've stayed at that . Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie . < br / > < br / > I give " Escanaba in da Moonlight " a 4.5 out of 10 .
I'm a big fan of Naruto , even though I haven't watched every episode or read every manga . < br / > < br / > I really liked the first Naruto movie , and to tell you the truth I was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good ( or action packed ) as the first ( mainly because this one in Australia only had a PG instead of an M , which is a PG - 13 US or 12 UK ) . But I was wrong ( thankfully ) ! The animation was more improved ( although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed ) and was very good especially in the fight scenes . < br / > < br / > Speaking of that , let's talk about the fight scenes ! The animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining ! I especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors ! All the characters you want are here ! Naruto , Sakura , Gaara , Kankuro and Shikamaru ! If only Temari was in the movie , Shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion ! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS ! In my summary at the top I say that this qualify's more as a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode . And it does ! The action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting ! Overall , this is a excellent anime Film that is a must-see for any Naruto fan ! 5/5 ! 10/10 ! 50/50 ! 100/100 ! Alright I'll stop !
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it . It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever . I liked this one even more than X-men . In fact , this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either . Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade . He is just not an emotionless super hero . Also , this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg - 13 rating . Sure comic books are for kids mainly , but I like a little more in my movies . Let's face it , if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic . This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't . A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy . Let's face it , none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight .
Not only unique for its time but one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time . Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures . Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has . Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far . < br / > < br / > This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb . < br / > < br / > Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C . Clarke collaborated to write this time less classic . < br / > < br / > Aliens a special message on Earth at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds . < br / > < br / > Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to Jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway . < br / > < br / > Any one who studied film and / or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film . < br / > < br / > If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie .
* * * SPOILERS * * * Whatever else can ( or can't ) be said about it , SURFACE is superbly crafted . The cinematography is simply stunning ( to say the least ) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art . Conceptually , the show offers a little bit of everything - and for just about everybody ( parents , kids , fantasy and / or fx fans ) . CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND by way of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure , say . And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise , either ; some surprisingly solid casting , here . This series SURFACEd , seemingly , from out of nowhere and , by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling , carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season . All things considered , a job very well done . I only hope it reSURFACEs next season ...
The Knowledge is a typical British comedy for the period . To someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a London cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces . < br / > < br / > The Knowledge however comes into its own for Knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through . And find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters .
This was a modest attempt at a film , though it appeared more like a TV pilot extended . < br / > < br / > Some may find this unfair , but it looks like someone saw " The Brothers " and " Save the Last Dance " , and thought " Hey , I could do that too . " Well , not quite . < br / > < br / > While I personally found the movie predictable , somewhat poorly acted , and contrived ( watch for the cookies ) , Carl Payne shows that he can carry off a lead role , and should be back on television . The leading lady ( can't remember her name , sorry ) was plausible too , but you keep thinking of Julia Stiles ( she was the one in " Save the Last Dance " , right ? ) because this one was really stuck in " white girl " mode .
I just wanted to say that I am watching National Velvet on TV , it is now Feb 2006 and I was checking on dates details , etc . Surprising to see it was made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old whilst Liz Taylor only 12 , what an accomplished English actress she is . < br / > < br / > To put some Americans contributors right : There are no Irish villages in England . Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the English countryside . The scenes shown are supposedly taken on the South coast of England between Brighton and Arundel ( county of Sussex ) . No such scene exists now unfortunately . Like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches . < br / > < br / > So please , all you lovely Americans , do not confuse Ireland with England , ever ! we take great exception to it . Like confusing Texas with Coney Island .
Deepa Mehta's " Fire " is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic . A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative , upper middle class Indian households , this is a film no one should miss . Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible . A . R . Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film . Mehta uses Rahman's score and together , they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support . This film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it . Lesbianism is just a part of the film . It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning .
Quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film . If you are interested in film history , to truly understand the innovations Eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing Potemkin along side most any film made before it ( those of D . W . Griffith offer a good contrast ) . It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time . However , even today , few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium . < br / > < br / > If you are not interested in that sort of thing , Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made . You should see it , buy it , and tatoo it to your chest .
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie , I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan , to say the least . However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster ( both great actors ) , I just had to watch the film . Williamson is a Dakota Smith , an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain ( Robert Forster ) . Forster is always watchable , it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd . It also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid . Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more films , the next one being " Down N Dirty " < br / > < br / > Eye Candy : Nina Richardson shows some T Mary Kapper goes topless < br / > < br / > My Grade : D < br / > < br / > Where I saw it : Showtime Extreme
This is a title in search of a movie . It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned . When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well : people , and fur . Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer . This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie . For the record , the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit . The film-makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped , tried to do both , and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way . The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena . But back to the crass part . This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear . I am not a fan of Landis ' original film but boy , does it look good in light of this . If you thought some of Landis ' humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here . The bubble gum scene , the corpse humor , the dog that ... you know , you'll just have to watch that bit yourselves . Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the " ugly American ' and bungee jump off the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night . This leads to him rescuing a young woman ( Delpy - Julie it's not worth this just to become a star in America . Ask Rutger Hauer ) from jumping to her death . She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting to ... I'm not sure , something bad . Ghastly French stereotypes , gaping plot-holes , a muddled ending . No matter , the studio cared only that the title would likely fool millions of " American Werewolf in London " fans into handing over their cash . For the most part , happy to say , they were wrong .
Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie ! It takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film , one supposes . Some have merely called the film " contemplative " , meaning slow and devoid of plot , however , one Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head : this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene . Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a Realtor who , predictably , talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on . So does just about every other character ! < br / > < br / > The only silences in this picture are dream sequences - - 1930 ' s Soviet propaganda snippets--and they are also its most interesting parts . This tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is . < br / > < br / > The device of filming most of the scenes in extreme closeup--as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds--gets old fast .
I've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004 , when I stumbled onto " Cidade de Deus / City of God " . Let me tell you something , this movie is probably as good or BETTER than " City of God " . < br / > < br / > The acting , cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience . I have not been to Brazil yet , but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of São Paulo . < br / > < br / > I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema . This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it . < br / > < br / > Something you want to watch , but nothing you want to go to sleep on .
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s - - films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh . So , because of this it's natural that I'd choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it , it was practically guaranteed to be bad . Sadly , while it was a bad film , it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny . At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films , you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting . Here , you never really see that much of the monster ( mostly due to the darkness of the print ) and the acting , while bad , is more low energy bad ... listless and dull . < br / > < br / > The film begins with some young adults going to Satan's Hollow to neck . Well , considering the name of the place , it's not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces ! Duh ... don't go necking at Satan's Hollow ! ! Well , there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky , so what do the teens go ? Yep , throw a dance party--a very , very , very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion . So it's up to the Sheriff ( Agar ) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication . < br / > < br / > As for the monster , it's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask--a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER . Not exactly original and not exactly high tech . To make it worse , it makes snorting noises and moves very , very slowly--so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it ! How it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me . < br / > < br / > Overall , too dull to like--even if you are a fan of lousy cinema .
* * * BIG SPOILERS ! * * * " Flesh Feast " of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great Veronica Lake's career . This has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker , and rightly so , I must say . As a huge fan of low-budget Horror / Exploitation , especially from the 70s , I nonetheless chose to watch this , mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site , but after watching it I had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film . The picture here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled ' Flesh Feast ' containing four films , including Sergio Martino's " Mountain Of The Cannibal God " and Dal Tenney's " I Eat Your Skin " . What the collection does not include , however , is this boring turkey . " Flesh Feast " is not only camp and ridiculous , but mostly quite tedious , which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long . Also , don't get fooled by the title , the film is not gory at all . Yet it is watchable , if only for its trashiness and , especially , the extremely stupid , but therefore somewhat entertaining ending . The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr . Elaine Frederick ( Veronica Lake ) , an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh-eating maggots ( don't ask how ) . A bunch of criminals ( or terrorists , or whatever ) , who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a ' mysterious ' commander . After an endless hour of nonsensical drivel , it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself . It was quite obvious before , but I still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious ... This is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake . Except for lake , the performances are ridiculously bad , even for a zero-budget production like this . Bad performances , however , are something I can easily forgive in films like this one . What I can not forgive , though , is extreme boredom . The final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff , but I would still recommend to skip it .
Its a feel-good movie that made me feel good . Some in this genre can be sickly sweet , but this script is restrained . The movie is funny and fun . The acting is great . < br / > < br / > If this were a musical , I would have left the theater humming the tunes .
A pity , nobody seems to know this little thriller-masterpiece . Where bigger budgeted movies fail , " Terminal Choice " delivers lots of thrills , shocks and bloody violence . A little seen gem , that deserves being searched for in your local video shop . That anonymous guy beneath is quite right , when he says , you'll never trust hospitals again ... it IS that effective ! Good ending , too , not really a twist , but it doesn't end the way one thought it would . Yep , that's Ellen Barkin in an early role ...
Well , I must say , I initially found this short to be quite average , but having watched it nearly 5 times since ( its constantly shown on IFC ) , I've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented . Sofia Coppola contributes a solid addition to the category .
This was so much better than i expected , the film oozed proffesionalism compared to other B-moive of this sort of budget . The script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including Lorenzo and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey . Aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are A-class . All in all this is a rise above other B-movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies , its certainly worth a rent .
Like many a child born in the 1980 ' s , I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that weren't necessarily the ' racier ' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 ( I saw those , of course , though not as frequently as now ) , but the ones meant for the " whole family " , Spaceballs , and this film . I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art , but just a campy , goofy , though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and / or adventure movies . But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a ) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids , if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities , and b ) once a kid sees it , when he revisits it , as I have a few times , it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around . It's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies ( Godfather of course , as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times ) , but one that references Brooks's own movies as well ; this is a filmmaker who isn't above poking fun at even his own style . < br / > < br / > Basic story - Robin Hood ( Cary Elwes in one of his best turns ) returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with King Richard gone , and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to , naturally , rob the rich to feed the poor . Along the way he meets Achoo ( Dave Chappelle ) , butts heads with Prince John ( Richard Lewis ) and the Sheriff , and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian . This , of course , is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes , and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing , so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle . It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm , such as the Godfather bit ( Dom DeLouise at his very best ) , Brooks's own cameo as the Rabbbi , Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns , and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs . Some of it is obvious , yes , some of it just takes right from the pages of Blazing Saddles , sure , but is it a good time for the right crowd ? Definitely - and for parents who grew up on the 70 ' s Brooks work , it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this ( even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated , all in good fun ) .
What about DJ Cash Money ? ? ? This film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s . There was only a small mention of DJ Cheese in 86 . < br / > < br / > Also , it's Grandmixer " DST " , not " DXT " ! ! !
To be honest , I've never been to the Congo or even Africa , and after watching the made for television movie Heart of Darkness , I do not think I'd want to . The movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible . Though the book was not the best I have read , after watching the movie , I seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more . Nicolas Roeg , the director of the movie , did a horrible job portraying Joseph Conrad's novella into a movie . I give Roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie , but this may not have been the job for him . The movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot . The set and scenery also lacked the beauty Conrad portrayed of Africa in the book . In the book Marlow had seen so many great wonders , but in the movie you did not get that same experience . No , I'm not blaming everything on the director ; the acting in the film was just terrible . All of the actors were dull and uninteresting . Throughout the whole movie I felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions , as if they were reading from the script the entire time . Tim Roth , who plays Marlow , did not portray Marlow's sense of adventure for his journey into the Congo well . Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was supposed to venturesome , but I didn't experience that in the movie . I would not recommend watching this movie , especially if you have read the book already . It does not come close to doing justice for Joseph Conrad's novella . Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with Marlow , on his quest to find Mr . Kurtz , where as the film did not . A great novella , but a very poor film . Heart of Darkness , the movie , is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad also called Heart of Darkness .
The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence , but it is not good at all . One 15 minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all . Every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things , except for the main girls I could not think of one movie where I had seen them before . I hate to bash movies but I also hate not being able to find something decent in movies . The film is sad , not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast . If it were redone and written over it could be awesome . If you want a good movie to see stoned , watch Grandma's Boy , or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused , but this is not a movie to be seen at all .
I find it terribly ironic that " left wing " Hollywood continues to hedge its bets , making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it . < br / > < br / > If you're a Sixties survivor and a committed pacifist , and you're hoping for an all-out condemnation of war like BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY or ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT , this movie will really feel like a rip off . None of these soldiers actually question this war , or any war , or the idea of war . They just gripe about having to do another tour . < br / > < br / > On the other hand , if you're a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor , this movie will really feel like a rip off . None of these soldiers loves America , or even loves the service . The way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys . It's not WE WERE SOLDIERS , and it's not SANDS OF IWO JIMA . It's not even mindless action , and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY . < br / > < br / > Ryan Philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie . Though he's devastatingly sexy , in a rough trade , men's room , bisexual sort of way , it's hard to picture him as a slow-talking ' Texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted . This is no Sgt . Croft in Mailer's THE NAKED AND THE DEAD . He's more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES , OTHER ROOMS . He can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit , OR that he wants his woman and wants her right now . He fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes , looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear .
< br / > < br / > A few years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar . I had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie , but it turned out that it was a flop and a B-Movie . < br / > < br / > The story is good , but there are no good effects in the movie . ( Maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget ? ? ? ) . < br / > < br / > If you choose to watch this movie be sure to watch it three times . The first , only and last time ! ! !
The Patriot ( nothing to do with the Mel Gibson film of the same name ) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that ' saving the environment ' thing in his movies . Which is fine . But it doesn't make for good action . < br / > < br / > When the plot ( ? ) of this film finally kicked in I saw the twist ( ? ) coming a mile off . Seagal's anti-warfare , care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle . For a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a TV movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by Dean Semler , the photographer of Dances with Wolves . < br / > < br / > Steven Seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring . As an action film it fails , as a drama it stinks , as an environmental message it's obvious . Avoid like Ebola crossed with plague .
Aslan Adam , or Lionman as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences , starts with an epic battle as King Solomon & his army defeats a load of guys although I'm not sure who they were & the film itself isn't too helpful in establishing the fact . Anyway , after King Solomon has slaughtered all these guys Princess Maria , Bishop Osorio & Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets King Solomon rule just about everything in sight . Soon after Princess Maria seduces Solomon & they have sex , meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever ( just two sentences long ) Antoine weds Princess Maria & is planning to rebel against Solomon & gain some sweet revenge in the process . Antoine & his guards attack & kill Solomon even though his pregnant wife Princess Almunia escapes with her protector Rostin with Antoine's guards in hot pursuit , after the shortest labour ever ( less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush ) Princess Almunia gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from Antoine's guards . Unfortunately when Rostin tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of Lion's as one of their own ! Year's later & the evil Antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy , Princess Maria has given birth & he has a son but Rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine , the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary Lionman who is more beast than man ... < br / > < br / > This Turkish Greek co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan & is a one of a kind type of film , I found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining . The script never seems to take itself seriously , it is a pretty funny film at times , it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring & some of the English dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on screen . None of it makes any sense , we get a boy raised by Lion's , an evil king , betrayal , dark family secrets , birthmarks that form the shape of Lion's in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by Lion's , crazy fight scenes , torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble , ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires & gymnastic rings , idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair & a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house-brick , can be stabbed twice , have his hands covered in acid ( this acid can eat it's way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug ! ) & fall over 20 feet onto a concrete floor & yet maintain no serious injury ! Aslan Adam is a terrifically entertaining film , I don't think I've seen another film quite like it that I can compare it too , if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like ' so-bad-they're-good ' type films & want to have fun , laugh & be entertained then Aslan Adam should be at the VERY top of your list . Total 100 % gold for bad film fans & those with a taste for the different & bizarre . On the disappointing side Lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end which is a shame . < br / > < br / > Director Bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although it's far from well made , during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background ! There is one point where Lionman uses a ' branch ' to pole vault but it's obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it ! Then there's the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing Lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever ! There are just so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just hilarious , stupid , bizarre or all three that I could go on forever . Just check the ending out when Lionman is jumping & flying about everywhere like he can fly . There's lots of blood in Aslan Adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence , a few stabbings & someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets . < br / > < br / > Technically Aslan Adam is pretty ropey , the period costumes are bright & garish featuring purples , yellows , reds & various other bright colours . The fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could . The music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film & is yet another bizarre aspect to Aslan Adam . The acting was bad , even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad . < br / > < br / > Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish , there are so many things to like , laugh at & enjoy in this film that I just ended up really liking it . In no way whatsoever can Aslan Adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but it's one hell of an entertaining one . I may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that I didn't dream it all ! The best Turkish action film about a man raised by Lion's you will ever see , period . Proved popular enough to spawn a sequel , Lionman II : The Witchqueen ( 1979 ) .
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a great , beautiful , twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out ! It's not simple . If you only enjoy Police Academy style , no-brains movies , this is not for you . The Cell is a deep , complex film with influences from movies like Cube , Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man , along with lots of completely new ideas . Wonderful , twisted environments , good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time ! Be open-minded , and you will love it !
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series , published in 1981 , it was not available on DVD until the last few years . Since then , it has become available , but initially only in the British format ( for which I bought an ' international ' DVD player , which you have to hack--illegally , I suspect , to see it ) , but the series is now available through amazon.com - - 3 discs - - for between $ 19-21 , to be viewed on DVD in the US format , no hacking . There were 41 reviews , average 5 stars . This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer , or the Manhattan Project , or virtually anything produced by the BBC .
' Toy Soldiers ' is the story of five misfits boys ( most noteably being Sean Astin , Wil Wheaton , and Kieth Coogan ) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the American government imprisons the leader's father . Lou Gosset Jr . plays the headmaster of the school , a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline . < br / > < br / > ' Toy Soldiers ' is a funny and pretty cool action , and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies . I think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast , but also , the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies , they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should . Trapped inside the boarding school , and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes , this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school . They're actually pretty clever about it , too . < br / > < br / > I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie . It keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that . Astin and Gosset Jr . give good performances . < br / > < br / > I , too , agree that this is an underrated action movie .
After having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies , I found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions , ( Although the story has much more to hold it together in the unedited version . Unlike Ninja Scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me . The animation while grainy is very original , and I just love the way artists in that year stressed shadows to show different emotions . I think the story is perfect . The beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters . As they meet , become allies and find out the their greatest strengths , a lot of heart was put into this .
A holiday on a boat , a married couple , an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning . < br / > < br / > I like boobs . No question about that . But when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment , mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim , my anger just rises to a whole new level . Take two guys ( a husband and another man ) , put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them , ad a deserted island , subtract all her moral issues , ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments , fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this . < br / > < br / > The acting is , I would say , good . There are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see . The main female character makes me sick . This is due to her lack of moral values . The man with the most fish get's her attention . Even though one of them is her husband , she sees no problem with being unfaithful with ( Manuel ) the other man because " I must do it to survive " . How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away ? And he won't even benefit from it ? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does . If she doesen't get approval for her actions , she's a victim . < br / > < br / > I recommend everyone to see this movie . This is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience .
This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen . Even being hangover didn't help . The plot is lousy , if existent . The relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help . I guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience . Do NOT see this flick
I watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed . Although I like this film and was engrossed by the story , I did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat . < br / > < br / > The story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic Policewoman . The location is a quaint Korean village . < br / > < br / > This film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic . However I was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman , yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life . In my mind he is a sweet , noble loser . < br / > < br / > Good points - Excellent acting by the two main leads , enjoyable snapshot of village life < br / > < br / > Cons - Flat ending < br / > < br / > Overall - Good but I prefer the Before Sunrise and After Sunset films ( or is it Before Sunset and After Sunrise )
Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating ? Because this one deserves it . While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books , I sat through this one with two women who are . Well , at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is . Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing , though he overdid it as he usually does ( nearly as bad as William Shatner ) . But that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude . It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is " really " happening , and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on . Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a " tune in again next week " climax . The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine , the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter ( I mean saxophone ? ? ? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing ? ) . So , in conclusion , I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible . Especially if you like disappointment .
This is just a long advertisement for the movie " The Death Tunnel " . Although it is an interesting history of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium , the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation . More " Ghost Orbs " which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera , and the " Ectoplasmic Mist " is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash . I couldn't see any " Shadow People " until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image . No scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena , only paranormal . Perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe , so be sure to make plans to visit the Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville , Kentucky .
I know that Chill Wills usually played lovable old sorts in Westerns . But his role in this segment is something I've remembered for a long time . Wills could be a first rate villain . Yes , Burgess Meredith's Fall was correct ! That look in Hepplewhite's eye ! It expressed porcine greed , ignorance , and the threat of violence all at once . Quite a performance , I think . < br / > < br / > The segment itself was a good one , too . Question : couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism ? I guess it did , sort of , with Fall . But the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure , if he had it , as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite . < br / > < br / > There is one moment that was annoying but also necessary . And it is something that appears to recur in these Night Gallery segments . It's Serling's constant need to sermonize . For that's what we got , one more time , with Dr . Fall . I don't know what was more frustrating , losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop Fall from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity , all while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud , and , therefore , all but begging for Hepplewhite to strike out at him . But as I say , it was necessary . At least it was for me . Otherwise , we wouldn't have been able to see Wills ' performance discussed above . All done without moving a muscle or speaking a word .
Dr . Lucio Fulci ( Lucio Fulci ) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes . He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles ; this proves to be a bad idea , since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings . Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy , the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders . < br / > < br / > On the surface , Cat in the Brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci . Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment , axe attacks and various other bloody killings , the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds . But when one looks closer , it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies ( mostly Fulci's own ' masterpieces ' ); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted , some welcome nudity , and dreadful performances from Fulci himself and David L . Thompson as the psycho shrink . < br / > < br / > As the film progresses , it develops into an incomprehensible mess , with the ' borrowed ' gore footage inserted randomly , with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story . If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom , or Mario Bianchi's the Murder Secret , then you've already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain before . < br / > < br / > After much bloodletting , the film wraps itself up rather quickly , leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated . Watch the film if you're a Fulci completist , but I would suggest seeking out the films from which the ' good bits ' were taken .
" Hail The Woman " is one of the most moving films I have ever seen in my entire life . I watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out . < br / > < br / > This silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience ; unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won't watch it all the way through , and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough . This film could use a digital restoration , to help bring out its beauty , but I doubt it will get it from anyone , since its main theme is Spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit , and this is not politically correct these days . However it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships . < br / > < br / > The cast is magnificent , especially Florence Vidor , who literally glows as Judith , the daughter ; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan , the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside ; Theodore Roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride ; and handsome Lloyd Hughes , as the son David , afraid of his father , but really of life itself . < br / > < br / > This is a nice film to watch at Christmas , especially . You will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration .
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me . Everything I hate about films is present : fake sentimentality , extreme corniness , bad child actors and more feature abundantly . That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans , with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon . What ? ! That's a Rugby ball . The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like ( who , coincidently , teaches the class in a short skirt ) and gets them interested in football . Naturally , they're all rubbish ( don't forget , they're no hopers ) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso . Blah Blah , etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers , but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids . Hell , even the adults start to come round ; drunks are turned into caring parents , illegal immigrants are let off the hook ... groan . < br / > < br / > This movie stars Steve Guttenberg . Now , before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy , hold up a minute . Guttenberg is rubbish . No , no ; come on let's face it , how did this guy ever get to be in a movie ? I have absolutely no idea , and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea . Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either . She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it . Although I have no problems with the latter part ; her performance does the movie no credit . The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this . Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all . There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job ; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat , so don't bother seeing this movie .
" Inuyasha " was awful . This show was incredibly over - hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clichés . The characters are annoying and lifeless , the story line is boring and endless . I think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing , but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show Inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again . The script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor . The character design it ' s very ugly , I don't know why everyone love it , all have the same face ! : Big eyes , tiny noses , a line as the mouth and the typical anime haircuts . I find " Inuyasha " incredibly boring and dumb . This have to be one of the most over - rated animated shows ever made .
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films . As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it . < br / > < br / > Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts . Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also . He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor , check out KITTY FOYLE . In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be . < br / > < br / > This is a Christmas classic . The settings and the story make for a great Christmas romance
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life . To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer ( Carl Crew ) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye . I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue , however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac . As he was so selfishly / inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer . Every person that he lured back to his apartment , he was attracted to and had feelings for , and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him . In the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what I noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him . It was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons . < br / > < br / > The scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart . One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with Jeffrey . When the guy left the pub , the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey . I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer . His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real , I was shivering in my seat . His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio ( Private Pyle / Leonard ) in the film ' Full Metal Jacket ' looked just before he gunned-down the General in the toilet barracks . < br / > < br / > If your an emotional person I wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not , than go ahead and watch it .
Let me start out by saying I LOVE horror movies . Big budget , low budget , big name actors , no name actors , it doesn't matter . And when it comes to judging movies I am very forgiving . This movie however , is pretty bad . < br / > < br / > The actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks I've seen . As the actors get killed off , you could care less . There is very little gore ( I have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one , because there isn't ) and the special effects are substandard at best . They steal so much from so many better horror movies ( Jeepers Creepers , Friday the 13th , Leprachaun ) and it still doesn't help . < br / > < br / > Luckily I saw this on Showtime and didn't have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my Netflix queue on it . There are so many better horror movies out there and I recommend you see those instead of this big letdown .
this movie really SUCKS , SUCKS REALLY REALLY HARD , this movie should be in the Bottom 100 , but it is so bad that almost nobody has seen it to vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time of " Manos - the Hands of Fate . " I should have him position 1 ( awful ) , but the reason for which I put him 2 was for Eve , the girl of the town that , besides some scenes of nudity , besides , I thought of voting for 3 , but like they killed Eve , I returned at 2 . it is that movies like this they should not be financed by anybody , since not even they took to the fame or other productions to the actors main , great falsehood , jaja , the history of a mining ghost that kills to " mansalva " and after they put an end to their misdeeds , it reappears , because with the end they shitted it very ugly . < br / > < br / > FINAL SCORE ( VOTE ): 2 ( for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful Eve )
This is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before . Not much action in this one though . Again it's about the guy protecting the president . He's macho - as usual , and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual . Does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president ? ! And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around . Stereotypical and predictable to the last toe-crumbling minute .
My God , this was a fantastic film . Every time we watch it takes us to another place of " WOW " . Rhett & Scarlett were played brilliantly by Joanne & Timothy . They did a fantastic job revising the roles of our two favourite heros . Everyone ! It is a must see ... Dont deprive yourself of this movie . If u loved Gone With The Wind you will love this mini series . Go Rhett ! ! ! Go Scarllett ! ! !
K , one day my father picked up a movie with a ' neat ' cover . Got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before ! .. Ok so it started ... interesting start , cool robots and disgusting gore ( eek ) on a strange planet ( actually it was Pluto wasn't it ? ) ... Blablabla I could tell the whole story but I rather not point , WTF NEVER EVER pick up a movie with a lame ass name , and seriously don't EVER I mean EVER judge a book by its cover ( err tape .. ) it looked like an interesting movie HOWEVER it was a slap to the face for sci-fi movies , its DISGUSTING . I mean it was so bad I just started laughing ( I swear it tryed to be serious ) I CANT DESCRIBE THE STUPIDITY ! It killed more then a million brain cells of mine I can't even write a descent critique . ITS THAT BAD ! Argh and I wana prepare you for something " strange ' * COUGH COUGH * mechanical p3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Sorry just had to say it , its so funny , think of it as a commedy or a parody of sorts for sci-fi movies . Its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging . What the hell was this director thinking ?
Let me just say that GRANNY was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves ! ! ! the best indie horror movie I have ever seen that is only 58 minutes long ... It is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time . You people should love this . I give it a 10 out of 10 ! ! !
I was surprised that I liked this movie . But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th . There were a number of cheesy elements , yet at the same time there were many cool ones . The story line was good--predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies , but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile . There are some memorable scenes worth watching . A few issues I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters . For instance in the opening scene the scarecrows ( which were humans on stakes , whose blood was drained to grow the crops ) , looked very real , but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks . There were more than several gaps in the plot , and the acting was mediocre , but at least it sounded like how real people talk , unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it . The culmination of the last scene , when the main character says " I'm not a Baker , I'm a Connell ! " and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying , as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point .
I'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs " lesbian " movies these days : murderous bisexuals ; psychotic murderous lesbians ; women who experiment with other women , but end up with men at the end ; ridiculously good-looking women who only get w / each other to turn men on , etc . < br / > < br / > Thankfully , FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal above this garbage . It is a credible love story acted MARVELOUSLY by every cast member , down to the least of the supporting actors . Aside from having a very engaging central conflict , the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins . < br / > < br / > I have also seen TIPPING THE VELVET , but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the former , both in character / conflict development and the quality of the acting . < br / > < br / > FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch , offering lesbians everywhere a great follow-up act to BOUND .
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me , this is so much more that a show that appeals to women . This is the story of a family , possibly an unusual one , but a family none the less . It centers around a mother and daughter , Lorelei and Rory Gilmore , two bright , attractive , and in their own ways successful women . Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow , CT , a small New England town with a sense of history , and a population of people that may be unusual , but acts as a dysfunctional family . The show also throws in the relationship between Lorelei and her parents , Richard and Emily Gilmore , old money DAR WASP people who do not approve of Lorelei's choices in life , though Lorelei doesn't care . The relationships story and through line are what makes this show , in my opinion the finest on the WB network ( soon to be the CW ) . Watch this show !
Ladies and Gentlemen .. Be sad ( or be glad ! ) .. We are in the disgusting forensic T . V Series-ERA ! ! Now count with me and anathematize our Luck : < br / > < br / > " CSI : Crime Scene Investigation " , " CSI : Miami " , " CSI : NY " , " NCIS " , " Crossing Jordan " , " Da Vinci's Inquest " , EVEN " The Cosby Mysteries " ! .. Didn't we Already Have ENOUGH ? ! < br / > < br / > From the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner ( or a team ) who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy .. and what a nauseating mission to do . So you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly , accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of T . V . < br / > < br / > OH GOD .. Once we had the great days ; the good cop ( or detective ) ERA such as Columbo , Kojak , Magnum , and Simon & Simon . Or the good old Sci-Fi ERA , like The Six Million Dollar Man , The Bionic Woman , Knight Rider . And oh boy we've got also the hot & sexy such : cover up , The Love Boat , Baywatch , even a flop as Thunder in Paradise . < br / > < br / > All of those were unforgettable , original , had good .. real good thoughts , action , women .. Till THE X FILES came .. And then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact : The Catastrophe ! < br / > < br / > X Files Undoubtedly was one of the greatest , but there was a few slight disadvantages , we had have agent Dana Scully ( medical doctor and FBI agent ) at every episode doing an autopsy .. , and of course her lap ( as the series succeed ) became part of our living room , so the thirsty-for-money producers loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth .. Therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification : The Forensic ! < br / > < br / > But it became so ugly , full of deformation , and very cruddy just like BONES . Plus the unsexy present of Emily Deschanel , and bleeder as David Boreanaz ( he was much better in angel ) , and all of these corpses .. To the extent that every time i've watched it I found my self screaming AAAHHH ! ! What a terrible gross ! ! .. < br / > < br / > Cancel it please .. You've canceled before real good shows such as ( The Lone Gunmen ) or ( A Man Called Hawk ) . Here it's a bad one .. So please .. Little Mercy and enough with the Bones-ERA ! ! ! .. or we'll drop dead ourselves of Nausea and Monotony ! !
After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar ( Nicholas II ) , and his failure to secure the army's support , I decided to give this film a try . < br / > < br / > I watched it with a completely open mind , not knowing anything about it ( except its reputation ) . < br / > < br / > These are the things that impressed me the most . < br / > < br / > 1 ) The shots of battleships , and the soldiers used as extras . More than once I stopped to think " if this was done in this time and place , 80 % of this would have been computer-generated " . < br / > < br / > 2 ) The Realism in it . From the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend " Killed for a bowl of soup " , this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause ( which , thankfully , hadn't been invented yet ) . < br / > < br / > 3 ) The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence . From the first shot , when the limbless man appears , you get the idea something might be wrong ; since the overall shots are composed , though , you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings . Then an amputee appears , and people start falling in dramatic poses . Still , the shots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear into scene , and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear . This scene is easily worth the price of admission . < br / > < br / > 4 ) The fact that this movie is 100 % unadulterated propaganda . Then again , when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with " propaganda " ; only a different kind . < br / > < br / > Overall : a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative . Nevertheless , Metropolis , The Cabinet of Dr . Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive , edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today . They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive .
KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars , including Best Picture of 1979 . This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years , walks out on him , leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had . Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed , but real human beings with hearts , souls , and brains . For instance , in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she's leaving him , she doesn't just storm out the door ... she gives him the keys , her credit cards , the dry cleaning ticket , tells him which bills have been paid , and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married , no more . This decision to leave was not a whim ... it was thought about and Joanna felt , with no other option than to leave , if she was leaving she was going to do it properly ... and with no specific plan in mind , she did not think it right to take Billy . Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer , a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon , he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces . Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna , the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son . Hoffman is at the top of his form here . I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy ( Justin Henry , Oscar nominee ) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall ( a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction ) . Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy , the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father . Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor , Margaret , who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion . This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too ... Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream ... Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party ... Billy catching his dad's one night stand ( JoBeth Williams ) on her way to the bathroom stark naked , but it's the moments of human drama you remember ... Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym ... Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene , he tells the guy in a whisper ... " Shame on you . " And of course , the finale where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy , which I found a little hard to swallow . Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind ? But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie , masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast . A must-see .
My brother-in-law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video . This should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible . It was . From the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible . It does not even quite register as a " B " movie . Maybe an N or a P . One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen . From the rubber raptor-on-a-stick to the still-breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines , this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free . < br / > < br / > Skip this one altogether--unless you want to play Mystery Science Theatre with your friends , it will provide good ammunition .
Man , I went to this movie because of the great preview . It looked like it had a great story and nice special effects . < br / > < br / > Boy was I wrong . I wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects . A cartoon dino , of cart board would do even a better job then this . The story was fine , if it would have been taken on by a big movie producer . Who would trow in some more money to make the effect more life like . The only thing I liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere . < br / > < br / > Even worse where the cars , in one scene 2 characters walk along the street . If you watch those cars you'll see the following : Taxi , car , motorcycle , tri-pod , big bus . And about 4x in a row ! < br / > < br / > And then there is the " butterfly death " that would set the whole " evolution changes " in to progress . If that guy didn't step on the butterfly , the next dino would have eaten it anyway ! So that's absolute bull . Then , if you change something in the past , the future will be different in the same instant . Not in those " time waves " they made . But hey , if the future changed in a split second , the movie would be even worse , but more realistic though . This is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh . I spend way to much money on this movie in the theater . And then they tell me this movie had $ 80 million dollar budget . WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY GO ? ? ?
I have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh , it makes me think , and it makes me cry . Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy ( and I'm kind of glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady turned down her part ) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared . < br / > < br / > Its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together . They stand beside each other no matter what , even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways . < br / > < br / > I'll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone I've shown it to I'd say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it , you'll love it and want to share it with others ! 10 stars all the way !
What a tedious turgid boring mess . This is a classic example of all that is wrong with contemporary English theater & film . About as exciting as a closet full of dirty socks . The very opposite of living film . Only the presence of Joanne Whalley gives it any spark .
After spending half an hour examining Rumors , a gay bar located outside Tupelo , Mississippi , SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts focus to the murder of Scotty Weaver in Bay Minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects . But there is a problem here . Bay Minette isn't near Tupelo , as the film implies . It isn't even in the same state . It is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal Alabama . < br / > < br / > Director Malcom Ingram doesn't exactly rush to point out this fact , nor does he bother to mention that while Bay Minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road , it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of Mobile , Alabama--which has a noticeable gay community , quite a few gay bars , and even a congregation of Metropolitan Community Church . If Ingram is disingenuous on these points , one has to ask if he is on others as well . < br / > < br / > Speaking as someone who was born , raised , and continues to live in Mississippi , I have to say that I find most of SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey . Neither Meridian nor Tupelo , the communities upon which Ingram focuses , are as rural , small , or as isolated as he would have you imagine , and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies . That said , Ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community , and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture , which tends to hold those who frequent bars--be they gay or straight--in low esteem . < br / > < br / > SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is , in my opinion , an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda . Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face major , sometimes frightening challenges ? You bet they do--but that's no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree . The DVD includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes , but I found the feature film itself so ridiculous that I didn't waste any time on them . < br / > < br / > GFT , Amazon Reviewer
At what point does a film become so bad it's good ? Compelling in it's awfulness , Darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c * * p cinematography and for that alone , probably deserves some kind of award . < br / > < br / > The plot revolves around the age old battle of Heaven and Hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead . In the case of Darkhunters , the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats , a hooded Grim Reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire , a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day-release from Kwik-Save . < br / > < br / > The protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely , a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuers . < br / > < br / > The plot is spread thinner than a dieter's sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense . The acting is laughable , comparable to a school play - although that would be an insult to many educational establishments . And the dialogue ... oh , how my sides ached ! With the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as " life's unwanted gherkins " by the flame-glow demon , you wonder whether Hell really is a McDonalds . < br / > < br / > But is is bizarrely compelling , you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get - at just over 80 minutes , it's worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles .
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was I wrong . This film was boring , especially in the beginning and the middle parts . I cannot comment on the ending because I just couldn't stand watching the whole film . The premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense . This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film . So if you are having trouble with sleep then I recommend that you rent this film .
A precursor to " Citizen Kane " in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon , here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks . In Spencer Tracy's 15th film he already looks middle-aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young ! < br / > < br / > A little silent-screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable , well-written drama .
I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it . I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film , which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer . It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake , but also his own ... yet it's so much more than that . It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty , sticky , sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward . < br / > < br / > The characters are ( for the most part ) multifaceted and very well-written and performed . The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly . However , there was one weak link in the chain : Justin Timberlake . The best I can say for him is that he can pull off crying ... it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly . However , Justin's Ronnie was flat , but as an actor he was trying very hard . I would definitely give him another chance . < br / > < br / > Lazarus and Rae ( Samuel L . Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively ) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other . This is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and , luckily , both of the actors were up to the task . < br / > < br / > The music was very bit as good as you would expect , especially when Mr . Samuel L . Jackson sings the blues . Phenomenal . < br / > < br / > On the technical side , all was brilliance as far as I could see . It was well-edited , well shot , and well-mixed ... everything was great . The character and set designs were just right , the casting of the supporting characters ( even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards ) was spot on ... Loved it .
I am shocked and amazed to find reviews short of miserable for this horrible film . I rented this " movie " or feces , whatever you wish to call it , with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching . Just listening to the dialog left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth . This film was about as intelligent as an ass pimple . I hope I never see that bra-less , raggedy Anne look alike ( Julianne Nicholson ) again.It was like watching the most putrid pilot for a sitcom that will never make it to television , but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes ( all I could bare ) this was an excruciating 90 minutes .
Following the World War II Japanese attack on U . S . forces at Pearl Harbor , " The Eastside Kids " : Leo Gorcey ( as Muggs ) , Bobby Jordan ( as Danny Connors ) , Huntz Hall ( as Glimpy ) , David Gorcey ( as Peewee ) , Ernest Morrison ( as Scruno ) , and Bobby Stone ( as Skinny ) want to serve their country . But , both the U . S . Army and Navy reject them as too young . Still wanting to " knock off about a million Japs " , the " boys " attack an Asian clerk , who turns out to be Chinese . The unfortunate incident does , however , lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty Japanese and German people . < br / > < br / > If " too young " is defined as " under twenty-one " , only Mr . Jordan and Mr . Stone would be rejected for military service . But , it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by Mr . Gorcey and Mr . Hall . " Let's Get Tough ! " was made during what the script accurately describes as " open season on Japs " - for this and other reasons , it hasn't aged well . It's a wasted effort , but the regulars performs ably , with Tom Brown moving the storyline along , as Jordan's spy brother . < br / > < br / > * * * Let's Get Tough ! ( 5/29 / 42 ) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey , Bobby Jordan , Tom Brown
A beautiful film.John Garfield's character is a distant relative of " Les Miserables " ' s Jean Valjean while detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo's Javert , the ruthless arm of law . < br / > < br / > Like in many films noirs , the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary , redemption , and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.But even in the luminous daylight , danger may appear suddenly , as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.John Garfield - an actor who , as Leonard Maltin points out , should be rediscovered : I've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in " gentleman's agreement " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused ( the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person , but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colorful characters ( grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary . Humor is also present in the strip poker game as the Dead End brats fleece a rich kid . < br / > < br / > I recommend this movie .
I will keep it to bullet points so here goes : 1 . Very badly scripted . 2 . Tries to be like Resident Evil . 3 . Zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute Raging lunatics . 4 . Never saw blood clean up so easily ! 5 . Special effects not as good as the original " day of the living dead " . 6 . Acting not as good as the " Bold and the beautiful " . 7 . It looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week . < br / > < br / > Basicaly Med team plus Special Forces go into a Zombie infested university to find the first Zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague . All die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived . However special forces ( who were trained at kindergarten school scouts ) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons . Also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps . Overall load of rubbish .
Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of mexican cinema , a rare feat nowadays . < br / > < br / > It's pretentious : it wants us to believe that it is deep , only because some scene is out-of-focus , another is pseudo-surreal , yet another plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes tradition of laughing-crying faces , the edition is fragmented , and it is all so solemn . < br / > < br / > It has a weak script : the main story hardly develops , so it has other three smaller , needless stories , stuck into it . They are only good to make the film last longer . < br / > < br / > Most of the acting is bad . A true feat , baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast . < br / > < br / > There is an abuse of unnecesary foul language . To the point that the character of Paloma , who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child , uses it throughly . < br / > < br / > It is homophobic . The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the sorriest , and most punished , representation of a transexual I have ever seen . < br / > < br / > It is very boring . I ended up envying the people that left the theater before the end of the film . < br / > < br / > Whatever it tries , it has been done better , in Mexico and elsewhere . < br / > < br / > In other words : " Para partirte la madre , nada como una mala película "
I was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it . I stuck it out to the end , but it was painful - - especially having to listen to that voice of the child . As Socact - 1 remarked , even though the girl claimed to be from Chicago , she didn't have a Chicago accent - - It sounded more like she was trying to imitate a NY accent--but failed at that as well . I was so confused that I was waiting for the punchline . Of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child , why did they select this one ? And why force her to talk like that ? It wasn't even just the accent , it was the script , the monologue created for her . The reason I even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me - - this era in history , the type of characters that are poor and uneducated , the setting - - and the love triangle . As far as I'm concerned it could have and should have been much better . I was just sooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that I did about this movie .
I was looking forward to seeing this movie , unfortunately I should have listened to my daughters advice . This should have been a spoof , but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for . < br / > < br / > Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey and his comedy does not get any better , his co star was not able to back him up . Their son in the movie was invisible . < br / > < br / > The life of crime was a blink , and that was the missing link of the movie . The film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before , that where it lost it for me . < br / > < br / > I did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough , AlecBaldwin I felt was there to add some weight to the film . His character was not strong enough . There were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie .
Hard to believe - but it is ! I shouldn't be surprised . Commercials try to show how unique and " funny " a show can be . Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me , I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing , either . < br / > < br / > I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness , cuteness or humor . The characters were insufferable for the most part . Especially Selma Blair's ( which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this ) . The few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite . < br / > < br / > Rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all . And this is not one of them . Kath and Kim has exactly ONE redeeming quality - and that's Selma Blair . Despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful , whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between Britney Spears , Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian , Selma is still nice to look at . < br / > < br / > But if you want to look at Selma , go rent Hellboy . You'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her . < br / > < br / > All in all , Kath and Kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that TV is or ever has been . It sets a new low .
I admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story . However , the movie is done SO BADLY that most people I know couldn't sit through it . The movie was relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place , but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter . The music choices do not flow well with the movie , it seems as if someone just turned a CD player on in the background to put the actors " in the mood " . The acting ... well , what acting ? The only people acting are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland , even though Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role . As far as the relationship development goes between Erik Westermark ( Jürgen Prochnow ) and Julia Reuter ( Greta Scacchi ) , it is like watching a train wreck . There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their " sincere moments . " This is not a good movie . There is a difference between trying to get a message out ( could've been a documentary ! ) and trying to make a good movie . This is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it . As a matter of fact , as a native of Estonia I am offended by this miserable effort . This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghost chase excuse of a movie . This could have been much more !
Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film , One Crazy Summer , with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role . Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are recent graduates headed to Cape Cod in order to stay at Goldthwait's grandmother's for the summer . Along the way , they bump into Demi Moore being pursued by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang . Soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving , spoiled family that considers " work " a dirty word . The film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the Godzilla skit . < br / > < br / > Like Holland's first film , Better Off Dead , John Cusack adds immeasurably to the film . Otherwise , this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters ( as opposed to quirky ) . Moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers . Goldthwait's gags wear thin after awhile , and Armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade Z stuff . The tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing underdogs they're obviously meant to be . This is more of a hit or miss , kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
( May contain spoilers ) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives . While it is most certainly not perfect , it is much better than it is given credit for . The acting and photography are excellent . Some of the musical numbers are great ; including the title number , " Where Do I Go ? " , " Easy to be Hard " , and " Black Boys / White Boys " . While I have not seen the stage musical , I think that it clouds the judgement of many . This is not the musical you see in theatres . Do not attempt to compare them . The theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch , but it would never have had the same effect on film , so a plot had to be added . And the ending that has been added is just amazing . The movie left me feeling like I had actually watched something important , unlike most of today's movies , which only satisfy on one level .
Probably the best Royal Rumble in years . < br / > < br / > Match 1 sees Edge battle Shawn Michaels in a good but very long match . Next up one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - Heidenreich takes on The Undertaker in a boring casket match . Match number 3 sees Bradshaw defend his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good contest . The next match up sees Triple H defending his 10th heavyweight title reign against Randy Orton in a great match up . < br / > < br / > Next up the Royal Rumble takes place in which 15 Raw superstars and 15 Smackdown ! superstars hit the ring to try and win the rumble and face the champion whoever that may be at Wrestlemania 21 . Highlights included Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder getting his ass kicked by Chris Benoit , Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly ! All of the superstars beating the crap out of Muhammad Hassan , and Raw superstars vs Smackdown ! superstars ! < br / > < br / > Not a bad PPV at all . < br / > < br / > Edge vs HBK - 8/ 10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The Royal Rumble match - 9/10
This film came as a gift - a late-night offering out of the blue - so unlike other reviewers I had no preconceptions whatsoever . I found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm , its own unfolding . I was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as I willed for " good " to prevail - but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes I was on the side of the " bad " guys . The film is quite quite beautiful - the word " elegiac " comes to mind , and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy . Far from being depressing or confronting , to me , the film acknowledges deep suffering - and then , by its cyclic nature - with the births and re-births as well as the deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an Aussie poet , there is " sometimes gladness . " Oh gods , I feel as tho I've just written a love letter to this film - but there it is . Hola !
Cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it , but ( based on the many literate comments ) actually GET IT ! I for one have always considered Paul Mazursky's " Tempest " a musing on the Shakespeare play of the same name , as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here . On the other hand , if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play , you should look elsewhere . As an experiment , however , it succeeds just spectacularly . Charming , moving , funny , sad , dramatic ... it's all of that and much more . Cast , locations , script , music are just fantastic . Cassavetes and Rowland were never better . Susan Sarandon's turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future . Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes . What's more , the always great Cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him ! A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more " modern times , " Mazursky's " Tempest " burns brilliantly !
I agree with the comments regarding the downward spin . The last view shows have been a little better , but surely the writers need some more direction . I think the characters are still interesting , although sometimes they spin into the " white trash " things a little too much . Subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like " Office " . I would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup . One would think that Karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows , but they only scratch the surface of the subject . In my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses . We can handle more heady content . It has been proved before in many other shows .
I have reasons to love the great users of a camera ; fluid direction of action lends itself to fast-paced adventure and comedy narrative ; but such a skill , in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann can also be applied to idea-level work . This is Paul Wendkos ' masterpiece . Its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences . General Hector Cordoba is setting up as near-emperor in Northern Mexico , and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing . he sends his crack mission unit , divided , apprehensive but determined , led by George Peppard , to get the cannon back and bring back Cordoba alive , to put an end to the rebellion . Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba ; the ladies in the piece are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York ; with the squad even further comprised of Nico Minardos , Peter Deuel , and Don Gordon . Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell . Also horning in on an already fantastically-dangerous operation are Miss Ralli , and a stubborn Mexican Teniente ( Gabriela Tinti ) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set up on his own . The danger is multiplied when Gordon's brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch ... and he decides he needs to kill Peppard . The attack that captures the cannon , when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type , is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history ; the penetration of Cordoba's stronghold , the revelations uncovered there , and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory--or almost victory--are flawlessly presented . This is a beautiful color adventure film , with unusually strong costumes , acting , lighting , art direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein . The script by Stephen Kandel is probably his best ever for a feature film . This is probably the most underrated major western at the moment , but I have always appreciated its heroes as result - getting hard-workers . But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home , " The trouble with being a " hero " - - is the morning after " . To find out why he says so , you will have to see " Cannon For Cordoba " .
I've seen this movie more than once . It isn't the greatest scifi flick I've every seen , but it is not a bad movie . The acting is good and the characters are more " real " than most in low budget sci fi . ( At least it isn't full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi . ) I especially like Elizabeth Pena . She is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some . < br / > < br / > Don't let the nay sayers run you off . See it for yourself and judge it for yourself .
One of the better musical bios . Dennis Morgan is great as the singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt . The supporting cast is very good , especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell . The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting . The technicolor is excellent . A simple plot , but the movie just makes you feel good . Morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer .
This show makes me ( and many others ) hate their lives . Let's face it , Zoey is perfect ; she's bland pretty , gets good grades , everyone goes to her for advice , she's popular , she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms . Reasons why I gave this show a 3 : 1 . The acting is horrible.Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses ( especially victoria justice ) on television . 2 . The characters are unbelievable and mismatched . You have your typical popular girl . A peppy , shallow , stupid , stereotypical , girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress . Then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.Then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers . Then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day . Then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress . And last a normal nerd person guy . 3 . The plot is boring , and lame . 4 . I hate how spoiled these characters are . Can't they just be normal ! 5 . Everything ends up perfect for them , and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink .
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie , I think he likes it too . ) It's amazing how intelligent people , talented even fall in to the same trap . < br / > < br / > I really like Reshamiya . It's amazing what he has done . No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself . < br / > < br / > And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ) . As intense as Reshamiya is I thought , he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role . Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care ? Sheer incompetence , carelessness , awful acting , banal background music , insensitive direction make it a real pain . < br / > < br / > Blunders rule . ( Ex . How can German Police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in English ? They communicate among themselves in English ! ) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood . There are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too . The worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care . < br / > < br / > Songs are the only saving grace ... < br / > < br / > Please don't repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget .. No problem ) . < br / > < br / > The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all it's a 50Cr movie .
One : your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours . These do nothing for the story , but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes . A good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about . Yeah , right . < br / > < br / > Two : these guys being like real professional Pros , they will engage each other in intriguing Pro talk : " Look , Grissom , these are what we call fingerprints . Everybody has them , and they are different on each person . So , with these fingerprints we can actually find ... " . < br / > < br / > Yup ! Exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around . < br / > < br / > However , not everything about this show is bad . Some stories work to some degree , and the colours _are_ really beautiful . They use red , blue , green , yellow ... all of them colours I've loved since kindergarten .
Too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs . the Indian . This screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline . It ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to Lonesome Dove . < br / > < br / > The series main characters were in truth cast very well , the filming locations were excellent , but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book .
normally , i would say i loved this movie.not for acting , although that was OK.not for the script , which was so-so.the reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense action , which starts from the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll.but , the problem with this movie , and i felt it was a big problem , was the horrible CGI.it looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects shots . a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest form.since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the movie , they should not have released it . i actual found the effects insulting.it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end product for the consumer.if it weren't for that , i would give this movie a much higher rating.my vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store . The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start . Seriously , if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard , I certainly can't remember it . While the acting talent is available here , from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz , Vera Miles , and Sal Mineo , the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived , filled with insipid stereotypes , and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey . Why must Hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all unidimensional morons ? It's too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were . The best I've seen to date is a memoir called Looking Back by a guy named Becker , but who else has even heard of it ? No one in Hollywood , that's for sure . They're too busy pushing tripe like this groaner of a movie to bother with reality .
I don't skateboard because I think it's gay but this game is really great it's smooth , fast , easy to play , and just fun even if you don't do so well . It can be just really fun to make the skaters just crash and burn , easily one of the best video games ever !
Second Nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003 , but perhaps the worst of All Time . Formulaic , derivative , and every performance phoned in , from far , far away . Everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror .
Im a huge M Lillard fan that's why I ended up watching this movie . Honestly I doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once I did watch it realize the story was pretty decent . A bad ending I must say but I did see it coming . It's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all I rated this movie 7/10 . < br / > < br / > The suspense of wondering what Lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie . < br / > < br / > Its a good rental ! < br / > < br / > 7/10
Idea is great , spoiled big time by the judges . < br / > < br / > Why make fun of people ? if what the inventors say is true , and as most of them say , they spent their life saving on the invention , the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people . < br / > < br / > also , it shows when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judges . < br / > < br / > The only one i respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table , he is a respectable person < br / > < br / > of course the English snob who claims to be a business man , wearing a suite doesn't make you one pal < br / > < br / > last but not least , the big guy who sits between the English and the crier . wake up man , the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one . an inventor is an attribute not a job man . < br / > < br / > i think they wanted to add someone like Simon from the American idol , they thought it worked there , it can work here as well . the context is different and the idea is totally different . < br / > < br / > it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude . < br / > < br / > just stop making fun of the people .
Making a film for under 1 Million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience . The balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor . < br / > < br / > What will be a triumph for Irish Cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed . < br / > < br / > I don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade TV show . < br / > < br / > The deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and I totally agree with what was written . What I would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them . The film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social / political commentary . < br / > < br / > My overall impression was that the film was rushed , thematically under developed and visually not up to standard . On a positive note the performances and music were very good .
As a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge Jane Austen fan , I was horrified by this adaption . As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park , I was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short . It felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly . There seemed to be no subtly to the relationships , particularly that of Fanny and Edmund , and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location . Despite having looked forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas I turned this off after an hour and went to bed . I will be interested to watch the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey , of which I have no much-loved version , to see if they still manage to bore me in such a manner .
In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse . Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film . Malkovich says he's going to kill the president , and he purposely calls Eastwood , and pushes his buttons . He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone . Malkovich brings a cold , but very intelligent mindset to his character . Everything he does , he does for a reason , and he's not shy about killing . Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich , but no one wants to listen to him . The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel . Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn .
I was looking forward to this so much , being a big fan of the book . However , when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I've ever spent at the cinema . < br / > < br / > In principle , the acting , the sets and the music were excellent , and are the main reason why I'm rating this a 4 . < br / > < br / > In this version , Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste . There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls ; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as " not just wicked , but vulgar . " < br / > < br / > There's also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me ; Sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset . While the book does have a happy ( and critics might say equally improbable ) ending , it doesn't leave you thinking , " Oh puh-leeze . " < br / > < br / > About the only things true to the book were : < br / > < br / > 1 . Sara's father being a soldier 2 . The lines between Sara and her father ( " Are you learning me by heart ? " / " No . I know you by heart . You are inside my heart . " ) 3 . Sara's friendship with Becky , and her ' adopting ' Lottie ( although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been ) 4 . The changing of her room by adding various luxury items . That part was brilliantly done . 5 . The basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there , but that's about all that is . < br / > < br / > People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience . Possibly . All I can say to that is I have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book . < br / > < br / > If all you want is a ' feel-good ' family film , then this delivers . If you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess ( in fact , if you've read the book ) don't waste time with this one . It's such a shame ; with a cast like this , if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic . < br / > < br / > Am I harping on about ' read the book ' this and ' read the book ' that a little too much ? Very probably . But if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie , then they should at least have done the same thing . Preferably more than once .
Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie . I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and A . R . Rahman for great songs . The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan . I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work .
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time , and one of my personal favorites . to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time . second only to the breakfast club . the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time . it's underrated , and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people . it comes on TBS maybe once a year , but sometimes longer . the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes . then the second half is pure honest , and most of the time serious . with only a few comic scenes . in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time . i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before . there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history . the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin . hes in high school who has a couple of best friends . his two friends are sex-sarved teens . the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures . that are very funny . gary is major in love with the new girl in school . he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her . he also cheats on the side . you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much . you can feel it even more in the second half . gary's friend turns out to be a creep . but his other friend is pretty cool . the movie shows how mean people can be . you can relate to a lot of this movie . the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy . but it's so much more than that . it's a very honest movie . it's also very 80ish which i love . if you love the 80 ' s or grew-up in the 80 ' s , rent this movie . but there may be some people that don't like the 80 ' s , but still may like this movie . i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think . it's very entertaining , and very funny . it combines very touching moments with very funny moments . it's an underrated gem ! i have the movie . i love it ! i give the last american virgin * * * 1/2 out of * * *
But quite dated today . Otto Preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then . It was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future . < br / > < br / > The film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized . < br / > < br / > Frank Sinatra ( and I've never been a fan ) playing Frankie Machine , is astonishing in his performance . One forgets it is Frank up there , the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed . < br / > < br / > Kim Novak , eternally gorgeous and talented , does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider , always there for Frankie . < br / > < br / > Supporting roles , particularly a young , handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin , are faultless . < br / > < br / > Eleanor Parker , playing Frankie's wife , is hopelessly inept . She swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top . A forgettable performance . < br / > < br / > The stagey , cheap settings are appalling , as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon . Almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness . < br / > < br / > The music was irritating , poundingly so at times . As if each nuance of the script ( example : when Louie is getting Frankie his fix out of a drawer ) had to be underscored at a high decibel level . < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 . Sinatra truly deserved his Oscar nomination . Worth seeing .
These days , Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies--especially since he has films like ALIEN , GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER to his credit . So from this partial list of his credits , it's obvious he's an amazing talent . However , if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school , you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness . That's because although it has some nice camera-work and style , the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving . However , considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground , then I am disposed to looking at it charitably--hence the score of 4 . < br / > < br / > By the way , this film is part of the CINEMA 16 : European Shorts DVD . On this DVD are 16 shorts . Most aren't great , though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD , COPY SHOP , RABBIT and WASP , it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying .
New Year 2006 , and I'm watching Glimmer Man again . Say what you like , I find Steven Seagal's movies amusing . Like many comments , good fight sequences - I particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration . Bit like Schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating . < br / > < br / > But the one I like here is Brian Cox . One of the most versatile actors around . Pity about his hand and foot , but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the " farm " . < br / > < br / > As the films went on I wonder just how the ever thickening girth of Seagal affected his movement ? . Never mind , it's entertainment ! .
It's not plot driven , OK ; it's not a character study , fine ; there's no action , alright ; there's no point , hmmm ... < br / > < br / > Maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in Palistine and parts of Israel these days in a state of violence , petty disagreements , deep rooted hostility , etc . But mostly it's long , long scenes of nothing happening - or things which look like they're dripping with meaning ( a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground , an Arafat balloon floating into Jerusalem , a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo ) but when you try to derive some meaning , there's no there there . < br / > < br / > Bonus : you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring .
" Robin Hood : Men in Tights " has received no respect whatsoever . It was hilarious ! Cary Elwes was excellent as the " Prince of Thieves , " and David Chappelle , Amy Yasbeck , Patrick Stewart , Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin all did fine jobs . I will never understand the hostility toward " Robin Hood : Men in Tights , " but I do know a great comedy when I see one . < br / > < br / > " Robin Hood : Men in Tights " receives * * * out of * * * .
Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident " The Wind and the Lion " is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa . < br / > < br / > El Raisuli ( Sean Connery ) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman ( Candice Bergen ) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of American president Theodore Roosevelt ( Brian Keith ) . Out of this simple plot John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre . < br / > < br / > The outdoor dessert locations , an impressive color photography , very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness . The musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly . < br / > < br / > Sean Connery is very good as the Arab leader and proofs he can handle almost any kind of role . So is Candice Bergen as the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances but deep inside is scared and has her weaknesses ; she gets to admire Connery and even understand his complete different focus on life arising from their also completely different cultures . Brian Keith plays one of his best roles ever as American president Teddy Roosevelt . < br / > < br / > Most entertaining and very good cinematographic sample in the genre . Give it chance , you won't regret it .
" In 1927 a young man , alone in a single engine aeroplane , flew non-stop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the entire North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris , a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles . In this triumph of mind , body and spirit , Charles A . Lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth--for in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality . This is the story of that flight " . < br / > < br / > Billy Wilder adapts from Charles A . Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name , in what is re-creation of Lindbergh's historical 1927 solo flight . Boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from James Stewart { himself a pilot } as Lindberg , and containing an intelligent screenplay from Wilder and Wendell Mayes , Spirit Of St . Louis is a sincerely well told story . < br / > < br / > In what at times threatens to become a monotonous film , Wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to Lindbergh's life . After the nicely told build up to the event , such as the peril being realised as Nungesser and Coli go missing { never to be found } whilst attempting the same trip in reverse , we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus . This is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying . This also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindbergh , thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey . Battling isolation { his only company is a fly } and chronic tiredness , it's here where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's devotion to the task . Aided by a terrific score from Franz Waxman and Academy Award nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield , Wilder's movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production . 7/10
Against my own better judgment I went to see this film today , and God I wish I hadn't . Awful . The first AvP film looks like a classic compared to this , it's THAT bad . These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller . In fact , this is what I'd expect an Alien and / or Predator film to look like if it was made by Uwe Boll ! This movie actually offended me , and Lord only knows what would transpire if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap . I can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film . < br / > < br / > Truly I don't know where to begin . I mean , the first AvP was poop , but it at least a semi-interesting story and setting , and occasionally some genuine tension . It didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely " leave your brain at home " basis . But this one , it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece . One after the other was a contrived ' suspenseful ' scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing , essentially bashing you over the head saying " be scared NOW " . As James Cameron once said , you can't be told to be scared , you can only have your own senses heightened . The guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself . It's a cliché for internet nerds to say " God , I was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving " , well this is exactly how I felt , even in the middle of the action scenes . They took this film totally seriously , which removed any possibility of enjoyment . Even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony . < br / > < br / > As for the characters , I knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on-screen at least have them doing SOMETHING that is relevant to the story . I don't care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend , I don't care about the mother who's " own daughter doesn't even know her , boo-hoo ! " ( a pair of night-vision goggles for a present ? Give me a break ! ) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother , what a guy . Hell , even the obligatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more contrived than usual . I get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending , as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids , expectant mothers being raped and the like , that that would make up for everything . I don't think so . < br / > < br / > Then we move onto the stars of the film , and again very little to write home about . Were the aliens well-designed ? I wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things . All you see is one of a mouth , a head , a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall , and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before Mr " I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos , think I'll do the same thing here " Editor goes at it with the slice tool . Also , notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain ? Hmmm . The Predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew ! Yes , the Predator was more impressive this time around , and I did think some of the new weaponry was cool , but that was about it . Also , since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World ? There were a couple of things that I kinda liked though . One was the use of sound effects and music from the original films ( I also giggled a little bit at " Get to the chopper ! " ) , although other references were stupid ( The main character's name being Dallas , give me a break ) . I also liked the visual FX for the Predator's vision , as well as how the hybrid alien looked ( certainly beat the one from Resurrection ) . But really , those are the only positive things . < br / > < br / > Overall I found this movie inane , pointless , insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures . That they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed . < br / > < br / > If they had any decency they'd remove Dan O'Bannon , Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this film . They've done nothing to deserve this .
Yes , dumb is the word for this actress . I know many have mentioned her beauty , but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair , lip gloss , and not so perfect body . Watch her walk away in those jeans , showing a rather large butt . Her butt spreads beyond her shoulders . What does that tell you ? As for the leading man , played by gorgeous Mark Humphrey , he was perfectly cast . A charmer . However , he and Lancaster just didn't match . She was out of place opposite this good looking guy . Good acting by Susan Glover as the sister . Angela Galuppo had a small role and was okay . But the film's director Philippe Gagnon , wasted too much footage on Lancaster . After a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability . And what a bitch of a wife she was . Snooping on her husband , being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat . Was happy to see her hit with the dart gun . I thought it might be the end of her . But alas , the script tells us otherwise . After torturing myself and watching this loser again , I still came up with the same criticism . Lancaster is boring to watch . This time around her hair , folks . Her hair constantly in her face , constantly tossing it back , became annoying . I question the writer , Alexandra Komisaruk's reason why a good looking wealthy man like Philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like Allison . When there were so many attractive intelligent women , with class , to choose . He picks this nothing . Is this the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing ? Oh well , it's all a matter of taste , I guess . This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea , folks .
This is a very famous Ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie . If you want to see some ninjas and some figures , want to know some things about Ninjas see this movie . This movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia . < br / > < br / > First 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best . You can just see Ninja figures and fight in this scenes . Between these are below the average , nearly bad as a movie . Acting is bad . Sho ( black ninja ) is the best actor in this movie . Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good . Scenario is also not good . Its so simple . Franko Nero comes near to his best , old friend from army and war . He also protects him from mafia but he is having sex ( go to bed ) with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to Nero negative . Is this possible in life ? What a friendship ! < br / > < br / > Finally this movie started a genre ; Ninja movies . Also there is the ninja master Sho Kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo . This film is below the average even it is a classic .
With so many good movies coming out in 1995 ( particularly " Mortal Kombat " and " Seven " ) , unfortunately , there had to be some bombs as well , and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring , predictable plot and a lousy ending . It seems that Antonio Banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since " Desperado , " the only remarkable film he's done . Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who DeMornay's stalker was from the beginning . Her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper-thin story . Pity that Dennis Miller was wasted in this film ; this part resembles his eerily similar role in " The Net . " < br / > < br / > The convoluted ending had me shaking my head , as I pretty much did throughout the entire movie . Plus , any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form , no matter how fake it looks , automatically gets the thumbs-down from me . < br / > < br / > To make a long story short , if you want to enjoy a good thriller , then avoid this at all costs . Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie . 2/10
Totally forgettable and almost unwatchable . If you enjoy bad acting , thin plots and predictably weak outcomes , pull up a chair . Of passing interest to see Bridget Fonda look-a-like Suzy Amis .
Shakespeare would have been outraged . The writers mutilated Shakespeare's amazing work . Ariel is the only believable acting performance . The African voodoo , secluded swamp , and " Gator Man " character make the movie a mockery of Shakespeare's true Tempest . < br / > < br / > Don't waste your eye-sight on this movie .
This movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of Michael J . Fox's generally respectable career . I should have known how awful this movie was when I rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter . Never a good sign ! Fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids . His character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey . His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega , a talented child . Vega is abrasive and not at all likeable . In fact , the only likeable character in the whole movie is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency . One of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box warning others not to waste their time !
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film , the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi . This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas . Whatever happens , when such a woman ages , and loses her charm and mystique ? Well , for those who are interested , watch this film . One : Okin , is successful as a money-lender , but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful . Okin doesn't have any children , but the other do . Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her , and is excited . Naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists ' characters . Bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness , and one's life-worth . Very good film indeed .
This movie was shot using a digital camera , and it shows . There were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer , also with the help of a terrible score . As if that weren't enough , the acting was also terrible . Now in Hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar , but here it was just BAD , especially by Satan ( Thomas Jay Ryan ) and Harvey , who ( thank god ) doesn't get to say much . After all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good , either . The jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward , and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next . The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines . All in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort . Thumbs down .
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books , so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie . But , I liked it . I found myself grinning through the entire movie . I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half . I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny . Just as I pictured them . And the town and scenery were just right as well . I recommend this film , but don't expect too much , just enjoy it .
Good , boring or bad ? It's good . Worth your money ? If you can spare it for a ticket , sure . Better than the trailer makes it seem ? Yes , oddly . < br / > < br / > There isn't much to the script - Guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash . Guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires , one of them is too honest to go along with it all , and a well-laid plan goes to hell . < br / > < br / > This could have been a poorly-executed Reservoir Dogs ripoff , but the skill of the cast and the director's ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing .
I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed . < br / > < br / > The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making . For the most part , this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical ( I don't say that in a complimentary way , however ) and just silly . It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life , which may sounds intriguing in some films , but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse . < br / > < br / > My criticism of this film is not upon the actors , rather the story itself . I found it boring and narcissistic . I wanted my money back , but considering it was a Film Festival , that wasn't about to happen .
it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is , how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on . i did not like the film . it's crappy ! < br / > < br / > there are orgies , they have taboo sex ( gay sex , bi sex , oral sex , rape , anal sex , masturbation , brother-sister-sex , brother-brother-sex , sex on drugs , sex without drugs , sex , sex , sex seems to rule their world . i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid . ) the story is just dirty and shameful . i wonder what made those people get up with this story . and above all : who cares ? < br / > < br / > the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well . the sound is poor , so is the editing and the " direction " is absent . the actors are admittedly fine , but guess what ! it's their job ! their job is to act ! no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job . do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely ? see ? < br / > < br / > i gave it 2/10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words . b movie charm ? camp fun ? nudity ? i don't know .
This is by far one the most boring movies I've ever seen ! And if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself . < br / > < br / > The movie starts of slow , the storyline makes no sense at all . People fighting doesn't make any sense . I could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie ( in most cases I didn't even bother ) It does nothing to keep you watching the movie , the only plus point would be the cinematography . New Zealand looks awesome . Everything else just plain sucks . < br / > < br / > The actors try their best to keep us awake , but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead . < br / > < br / > Do us all a favor , even if this gets on " On Demand " , Don't WATCH IT !
A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is a lush led me to foolishly re-visit this mid - 90s DTV entry . A kid is traumatized when he sees an Ice Cream man gunned down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho Ice Cream man ( Clint Howard ) . Something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream . Blah , blah , blah . < br / > < br / > Director Norman Apstein ( credited as Paul Norman ) made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward . That is what you get for having all murders happen off screen . And for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit . Just cast a fat kid ! Also , there is a scene where Vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies surrounding him . He was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his " Have I really sunk this low ? " shame full on . Despite being low budget trash , this did line up a few good names including David Naughton , Olivia Hussey , David Warner and THE PEOPLE COURT's own Doug Llewelyn . How you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me .
' Sleight of Hand ' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series . This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored . To wit , Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter . The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster . Through a strange turn of events , the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home . < br / > < br / > Rockford's recounting to his father , Rocky , of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer series from an earlier era . After much brooding and reflection and with Rocky's encouragement , Jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual steadfastness . < br / > < br / > Unfortunately , Jim's girlfriend , Karen , unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the Buena Vista Inn . The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman into Jim's car . The imposter , ostensibly asleep in the back seat , made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home . A couple of cover up murders ensue and Jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the L . A . police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest . < br / > < br / > This episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other Rockford Files episodes combined . James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case . This is personal for Jim Rockford . In this case , he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life . Unfortunately , this is not possible but Jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt . < br / > < br / > Despite the appeal of the main story line , many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode . ( 1 ) What becomes of the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend ? ( 2 ) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her ? ( 3 ) How could Jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this ? ( 4 ) The daughter stated that " Mommy didn't come back with us " . So why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride ? Regardless of these ambiguities , ' Sleight of Hand " is the Rockford Files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker . The suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel Rockford's pain .
After seeing the TV commercials for this film I marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs . In the end it was one of the longest 90mins I have ever spent . The Wog Boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void . < br / > < br / > A scene where the two ' Wog Boys ' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all . The only character that was worth watching was ' Nathan ' , played by The Castle's Stephen Curry , his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs . < br / > < br / > A word for this flic is boring . Save yourself the time and just watch the TV commercial as the only laughs are shown on it .
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic . Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie . After eliminating Rosemary ( here played by Patty Duke ) a coven of witches , again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets , preps Satan's son for world domination . It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor . Instead , writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting , plenty of candles , and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time . Gordon's the sole holdover from the original . George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and a very hammy Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets , subbing for the late Sidney Blackmer . Newcomer McHattie is the film's only real saving grace . He's very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything . The music by Charles Bernstein is suitably creepy , but so over-used , it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective . O'Steen , who edited the earlier Polanski masterpiece , shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever .
Yet another in the long line of " Don't " films of the late 70 ' s and early 80 ' s yet this one is much more than that . This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist . It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses that make this movie good . A young nurse arrives at Dr . Stephens ' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be . It seems Dr . Masters , a rather ambitious female doctor , has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas . Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions . There is the nymphomaniac , the crazy old crone , the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants , and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others . There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up . If you are a fan of cheap 70 ' s sleaze than this is the film for you !
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much ! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion ! I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose ! It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons . I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose ! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role ! I rate this show 110 % it is FANTASTIC ! The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love , the world and relationships from this show . Therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time !
I absolutely despise this film . I wanted to love it - I really wanted to . But man , oh man - they were SO off with Sara . And the father living was pretty cheesy . That's straight out of the Shirley Temple film . < br / > < br / > I highly recommend THE BOOK . It is amazing . In the book , Sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT . She doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body . < br / > < br / > In the film , she is mean-spirited and spiteful . She does little things to get back at Miss Minchin . In the book , Sara is above such things . She DOES stand up to Miss Minchin . She tells the truth and is not cowed by her . But she does not do the stupid , spiteful things that the Sara in the film does . < br / > < br / > It's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie . I can't help but wonder ... did we read the same book ? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility , behaving with honor and integrity , ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity . < br / > < br / > Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father , but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her . In the book , she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky . And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - that part of the film really was stupid . < br / > < br / > To see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me . We are praising a film that glorifies petty , spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness ? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity . I don't even recognize her in the film ... she's not in it . < br / > < br / > Good thing Mrs . Burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing . It's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book .
I am a huge horror fan , particularly Spanish horror . This film had so many possibilities to be good . It's a marvelous idea , a vigilante ghost nun , as most of what has come out of Jaume Balangueró's mind . Both visual and sound effects were also pretty good . But everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction , awful casting and a painfully bad ( exposition , exposition ! ) script . Too bad . Maybe Balangueró should write and direct himself a remake ... < br / > < br / > Moreover , I don't really understand why this had to be spoken in English by actors who can't really speak English ( and when they do , they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake ) . If you look at contemporary Spanish horror films like El Orfanato or Rec , the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story - and that is being realistic , being believable as someone like ourselves , like real people , because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal . Unfortunately , everything failed in La Monja .
The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980 ' s New York . This involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with , trying to stay in school , as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the Dead Kennedy's and have the name Skulls for their band name . Rex ( played by David Jacobson ) Plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds , and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful , and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better ! Billy Kane ( Played by William McNamara ) and Kate Kane ( played by Kara Glover ) are brother and sister . Although they roll with this crowd of thugs , these kids are not the same type of people as this group . They care for Rex and they care for others , and really show an enlightened side of themselves . While his sister sleeps with the head of the Gang , she is also falling in love with Rex , trying to show him that she is not a slut . But in the end , the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution , he finally feels it is time to end his life , while Animals of Sound played without him . But they like to think that he is not dead , he is just living his life to the fullest , riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean . This movie , was one of those movies where I was glad that I watched it . While it was extremely entertaining , it also had a big message to it . Something a long the lines that these kids had no direction , no future , no figure heads to look up to , but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids , or being destructive to everything . Rex showed them the beauty in angry music . Rex showed them the beauty in Rats , Disease and Murder . Rex showed they the beauty in almost everything , while some of those things have no beauty involved , they still were able to see that when used in poems , these poems speak to people . Rex played an important part in this move , who changed everyones heart from depression , to see that there is hope for them , and thats why he started to show them ; The Beat .
WONDERBIRD , certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon , drawn in a deliciously old  fashioned way , and sensationally old  fashioned in almost any respect , takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch ; accordingly , the kingdom , or at least what we see  the surroundings of the king's palace , seems devoid , uninhabited . < br / > < br / > A few inhabitants there are  away from the Sun  in the withered underground city . < br / > < br / > An advice  call it an allegory , call it a parable , only do not call it a fable . < br / > < br / > Because IMDb encourages prolixity , and maybe for other reasons as well , I will add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault .
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent , drunken cheapshots p * * * off three OTHER guys one night in a bar . When these three mysterious strangers , who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know , beat the living daylights out of one of our " heroes " , the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys ! The remaining two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes hold dear , including their fast-dwindling sanity . Phaedra Video's DVD sleeve features a critic quote calling the film " A paranoid street crime freakout ! " or some such , and the term more than applies here . Brooding , tense , very violent and low-key ( but still pretty slick ) , shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists ( who , to some degree , deserve everything they get ! ) . I give it a 10 .
I challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement . That is , IF you can stop looking at her practically flawless face . She also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting , but not nearly as much as I was hoping for . The film is extremely slow-moving and low-budgeted , though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated ; nearly the entire crew is on " suspended animation " , and the ship moves on auto pilot ! And the heroine doesn't rescue any of them , or bring anything useful back " home " ; it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end . There are also some long but rather tame soft-core scenes , and a couple of " Alien " - rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people . * 1/2 out of 4 .
Arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of Australia since Vegemite ... Predictably distasteful comedy with Barry Humphries in a dual role as boozy Australian diplomat Les Patterson and undercover agent Dame Edna ! So many bodily function gags that even the Farrelly brothers would have been sick , and several gross-out moments , especially the effects of the horrible H . E . L . P . virus . Only for fans of extreme toilet humor . Oh , and that ´ s the " NeverEnding Story II " , NOT the " Mad Max " George Miller , who directed ... * ½ < br / > < br / >
without a doubt , one of the most racially prejudiced films i've ever seen , with the prejudice being levelled against Hayden Panettiere as she has to move into a tough inner city school . She is constantly called " white girl " and other slurs based on her colour . Firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse ? and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace . The writers apparent desire to show they were " hip " also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition , not through talent but by intimidating their white opponents ! ! these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit . Hayden Panettiere has star quality but I would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further . All in all a charmless film that was a waste of time .
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school . I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles . I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things , or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles . its a good movie , based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto , Ontario . so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there , watch this movie . And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws , realize that in real life , this same stuff does happen . but thats all I want to say on that . The riddles are good , some are hard , some are not . But the movie also leaves you wanting more , more riddles , more explanation , just plainly , more . Something more I want to add , is that the ideas within this movie , the underground riddle world , does exist , but there is a lot more to it . To find it , you can not look for it . To never look for it , would be no way to find it . Leave your mark , and it will find you .
I found the movie very real just as much as Saving Private Ryan and gave an upfront account from the German perspective . The graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie . Stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle . I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history . This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again . The weapons , uniforms , and hearing it German while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie . In fact , this being a German perspective of the battle , I was rooting for the Germans , even though they were the agressor and ultimate loser of the war .
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge . Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates , who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now ( how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery ) . He hooks up with Mary Crosby ( Bing's daughter , around 25 and a total cutie ) , a princess looking for her missing father . Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy , short-ish Ron Perlman ( whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles ! ) . And John Carradine , who looks days from death and Hollywood Squares funnyman ( relative term ) Bruce Vilanch . If you ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch get decapitated , here's your film . But , then again , even that's not worth seeing , as it doesn't shut him up at all ( think he might have been a robot , but I nodded off a couple of times ) .
I can't believe that I let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this April 14 , 2007 . This movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring , I haven't even felt the gory impact of its " daunting scenes " which I deem to be complete failure to attract its audience . The worst even trampled me , cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy assisting her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate lodge to stay in for one night . I wasn't really disappointed with that matter , but this movie is a matter indeed for me , poor plot , useless storyline , naively created and I don't know what to say anymore . < br / > < br / > The title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to overture us viewers , maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real situational play . Good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway .
This is a true gem of a TV film . Based on a completely untrue story , it follows the course of the down-and-out football league club through their course in the English FA cup , where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles . The ending is unexpected , the performances are great , and Nick Hancock shows that he CAN do something other than host sports shows . My only regret is that I didn't tape it .
Low budget horror movie . If you don't raise your expectations too high , you'll probably enjoy this little flick . Beginning and end are pretty good , middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot . Quite a bit of gore . I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture , he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening . Nurse Charlotte Beale , played by Jesse Lee , played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end ! She makes some really stupid mistakes but then , that's what makes these low budget movies so good ! I would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave ! If you enjoy this movie , try Committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie .
Very enjoyable 50 ' s Western . I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans . < br / > < br / > Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation . < br / > < br / > He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout . Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions . They all joined as scouts after their loss . < br / > < br / > Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations . < br / > < br / > Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters . < br / > < br / > 50 ' s Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction . A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again . One to enjoy . Gave it a 7 rating . Likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time . < br / > < br / > For film-noir fans ... " The Big Steal " " They Live By Night " " Side Street " are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed . Bought and viewed . Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way . Some long ago and never forever .
Admittedly , I tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some beefcake shots of James Brolin . Unfortunately , there was only one , early on , and the rest of the movie was very tame , and ultimately made little sense . < br / > < br / > The story , what there is of it , centers on Nick and Julie Atkins , a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale . Nick , a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting Julie , who tries to fill the void by going back to school . Julie's longing for the passion that she and Nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time , causing her to do things like burning breakfast and misplace her husband's papers . At first she fantasizes about her husband , but as the movie progresses , she begins to fantasize about other men , and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets . This culminates in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage . Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship ? Is it worth saving ? < br / > < br / > This could have been an interesting premise , but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered . Characters aren't developed . Motives aren't explained . Background information isn't given . No exploration is made of how Julie got to the point where she couldn't control herself , and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future . The end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as Julie's fantasies , which are surprisingly underdeveloped . < br / > < br / > The acting is a mixed bag . Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she is given , although her continual self pity does become strident after awhile . James Brolin acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards , and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy into , he shows so little passion over the whole issue . The supporting roles are mostly forgettable . < br / > < br / > Disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story . More's the pity , since it doesn't even offer the eye candy it promised .
I'm a horror movie freak , and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks I've ever seen . The plotline is totally original ( who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity ? ) , the special effects are amazing , and the cinematography couldn't be better . Some may find it disturbing , but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie . It also makes a good point . The spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous . The spiral notebook , spiral seashells , spirals on cakes . Of all the shapes they could have used ( square , triangle , trapezoid , rectangle ) this was one of the best choices . If you can find this movie , definitely see it . It's certainly unique , and quite unforgettable .
Yes , I am ashamed to admit it , but this show is positively DEVINE ! ! ! It's so entertaining , and I have the absolute greatest time watching it.Ever since Cycle 1 it's been great , and I haven't noticed a downfall in it's glory AT ALL.Tyra Banks as you know is the host , and as fabulous as she is , there's also the other judges and co-hosts such as J . Alexander , Jay Manuel , Nigel Barker , and Twiggy.The main point of the show is for every girl invited to become America's Next Top Model , has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions.It sounds great already doesn't it , and let me tell you IT IS GREAT ! ! ! It's awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take , and each one is different , cool , and daring.Anybody who hates this show , doesn't have a clue , and I will tell you that this show will be on for a LONG time , so DEAL WITH IT ! ! !
A very , very , very slow-moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man . Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience , nearly half of whom walked out . < br / > < br / > Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles , the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent . Very little music or anything to speak of . The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head . He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album . Cute scene gave promise , but it went downhill from there . The rest of the movie lacks art , charm , meaning ... If it's about emptiness , it works I guess because it's empty . Wasted two hours .
I have just seen Today You Die . It is bad , almost very bad . < br / > < br / > 1 ) The direction and editing are awful , just awful . Almost made me turn off the movie , Fauntleroy ( the director ) has no idea what he is doing , he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all . Also , I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie , in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times . Pretty bad . < br / > < br / > 2 ) The dialogue is sometimes good , sometimes awful . I like the fact that they wanted to make Seagal's character and Treach's character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in Lethal Weapon , but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue DID NOT MAKE SENSE , and I speak English very well , it's not that I did not understand the words , it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever . < br / > < br / > 3 ) The script is pretty bad . Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies ? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities , why ? Is it useful to the movie ? NO . Seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie . STUPID . The story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason . The story is messy and pointless sometimes . They should have kept it simple and it would have worked . < br / > < br / > 4 ) In some of the action scenes it is not Seagal , it is his stunt double . You can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face . He also beats the guys with movie martial arts , not real ones like the aikido Steven knows . The stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches . < br / > < br / > 5 ) Steven is good in the movie . 90-95 % of the lines are said with his real voice . The rest is dubbing but it is not that bad . This was good . Also Steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in Submerged . He likes Treach as a partner ; at least he does not seem to dislike him . Also , he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies . I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body , but in the same clothes that he wears on the DVD cover he looks more than OK and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat . < br / > < br / > I really think that Seagal was willing to make a good movie . The fact that he came late and took off early from the set ON TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy does not look like a coincidence to me . I think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore . < br / > < br / > In the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for Seagal . Something like Out for Justice or Above the Law . I honestly believe that . But the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly . Too bad since I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was cool ( Ice Cool ) too , but the rest was bad . Hey , at least this gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past . I think that Mercenary might be just as badly handled . But hey , Steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least THAT is reason enough to watch the movie . < br / > < br / > I liked it , but it could have been SO much better . 4/10
Video Vault By Shawn K . Inlow < br / > < br / > My Architect : A Son's Journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not Rated : 116minutes Vault Rating : 7 < br / > < br / > What a thing to be fatherless . " My Architect : A Son's Journey " follows Philadelphia filmmaker , Nathaniel Kahn , as he desperately seeks answers from his father , the renowned architect , Louis I . Kahn , dead these 30 years . < br / > < br / > Louis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family . The funeral service , when the filmmaker was just a boy , was , shall we say , an unpleasant surprise . < br / > < br / > We find that Nathaniel only knew his father en passant , from his sporadic visits with his mother , whom , we are told , he loved deeply . This movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work , as if the magnificent structures hold some secret . < br / > < br / > To be sure , Louis Kahn was a gifted architect , but " architect " is a cold word . The man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art . < br / > < br / > Among his notable works , explored lovingly in the film , are the Salk Institute ( 1965 ) , The Kimball Art Museum ( 1972 ) and the monumental capitol complex in Bangladesh ( 1983 ) . The portion of the film where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka , Bangladesh , finds the work , but not the man . < br / > < br / > The film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in New York City and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania . Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmaker's ghost - father . < br / > < br / > Even so , the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place . The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem hollow . Not good enough . < br / > < br / > In scenes where the director meets with his half sisters , both from different mothers , one can feel the tensions of the years , the slights and hurts . One might expect them to burst into anger , but only the camera saves them from hostilities . Each of these children has visibly lost something . < br / > < br / > It might be pointed out that Khan , who seemed a driven perfectionist , never became rich . Instead , he became noteworthy . It was as if he sacrificed his family for his art . This is a crushingly sad and great thing . < br / > < br / > April 28 , 2005
This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi B-movie is what you'd have if you took an early Fred Olen Ray film and took out the fun . Or conversely , it's like an Uwe Boll ' movie ' but without as much ineptitude . A young nubile chain-gang convict ( C . C . Costigan ) agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop wacky Kim Dawson's plans of ... having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently ( that vile fiend ) . Anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction , well you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film at all . First of all when did Kim Dawson EVER star in anything other than soft-core Skinamax level crap . For that matter take a look at the resume's for Costigan and the Director before you take a hissy fit saying you expected something else . Don't get me wrong , for a space / action / soft-core / titillation flick , this film is STILL not good , but if you expected something along the lines of " Contact " , I DO NOT pity you . < br / > < br / > My Grade : D - < br / > < br / > Where I Saw it : Starz-on-demand ( Available until December 8th , 2005 )
.. is the Princess Bride meets ... well Trainspotting . But wait , really , it's a good combination ! This was definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a long time ... it has the kind of witty dialog I associate with The Princess Bride or Cemetery man , along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie ... the heroic feel of Princess Bride combined with the ( this is odd ) lack of any really good guys that Trainspotting had . < br / > < br / > I'm not saying it was as GOOD as the Princess Bride , but it was in the arena , and it rocked . Some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant , the plot is interesting , the characters - while SLIGHTLY anacronistic - are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature ( there WERE flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century , contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks ) but just in a bit of the language they used . The anachronisms made it fun , though , and NOT cheesy and easily dismissed . < br / > < br / > If you've ever read any Simon R . Green , or Gleen Cook's Garrett series , you know EXACTLY what this movie is . Check it out . It's great .
Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt , in his heart , was the right thing to do . The viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done . The adversity that coach Jones and Radio both faced was both tragic and predictable . People did not understand ; nor did they want to understand . But in the end , the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened . Radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little , besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature : Intuition , compassion , and love . Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how . It was sad the way coach Jones and Radio met . The practical joke that terrified the life out of Radio was enough to make you want to severely punish , not only the boys involved , but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it . However , on the positive side of the scale , the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies . This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed . Ed Harris was his usual brilliance . Gooding was flawless . Radio is an inspiration .
usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a monotonically descending pattern . This bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive . The acting , save for the male antagonist , was awful . The plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene , which is probably good as performance art , but it was wasted in this movie . Not sure why this movie was made .
A group of young travelers that just ran out of gas go into a weird wax museum called " Saluesen's Lost Oasis " owned by a strange man named Slausen ( Chuck Conners ) as the dummies are controlled by some mysterious force and a madman with special powers wants them dead . < br / > < br / > One of the most under-appreciated horror movies of the late 70 ' s ! This Charles Band ( producer of " Re-Animator " ) production has became one of the scariest and most unique low budget horror productions of it's day combining some psychological themes along without having to result some gore like the usual slasher movie . The movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some scares , the movie has became a cult diamond in the rough for the genre since then and this is well worth watching . < br / > < br / > Also recommended : " Pin " , " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) " , " The Hills have Eyes ( 1977 ) " , " Maniac ( 1980 ) " , " Magic " ( 1978 ) , " Dolls " , " May " , " Just Before Dawn " , " House of 1000 Corpses " , " The Devil's Rejects " , " Sleepaway Camp " , " Mother's Day " , " A Nightmare on Elm Street " , " Friday The 13th " , " Halloween 1 & 2 " , " Puppet Master " , " House of Wax ( 1953 and 2005 ) " , " Jeepers Creepers " , " High Tension " , " Evil Dead II " , " From Dusk Till Dawn " , " Waxwork " , " Nothing But Trouble " and " Psycho ( 1960 ) " .
If a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes , it's over as far as I'm concerned . This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense . A good movie has to start and end strong . It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise , but ultimately muddled and irrelevant . There are so many other movies from Asia to watch , many of which I am sure most of you have not seen , that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere . Why exactly does IMDb require a 10 line minimum for reviews ? I said my piece and I hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film .
A group of adventurers travel to the ' dark continent ' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana , who disappeared years before in a plane crash , and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess . < br / > < br / > Once again , my search for sleazy , European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco territory  a seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting , crawling with crap camera-work , and abundant with awful acting ( Franco regular Lina Romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing , elderly woman ) . It is here , in this hellish place , that I finally stumbled upon Diamonds of Kilimanjaro , an abysmal jungle-based exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it . < br / > < br / > Tawdry and unrelentingly dull , even by Franco's standards , this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level : the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan , albeit with a feminine twist ; the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens , although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in Africa ; and the death scenes are virtually bloodless ( Franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter , but despite initial appearances , this isn't a cannibal movie and it isn't that gory ) . < br / > < br / > Where the director does succeed , however , is in his casting of sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail-bait Diana . Running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loin-cloth , her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time , this nubile beauty makes quite an impression . Franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as treacherous traveller Lita ( who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions ) , and Aline Mess as topless warrior woman Noba , thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 1/10 from me ( although I'm sure he'll be receiving plenty more in the future  I have loads of his films yet to see ) .
No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius , but what we wonder about is : is he an insane genius ? So many people hated this film ! I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive , boring , disgusting and pretentious films ( such as the horrible recent film ' L'Enfant ' and the pointless and offensive ' Feux Rouges ' ) . But strangely enough , I actually think that ' Pola X ' is an amazing film , made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft , and containing remarkable performances . The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before . But then , Carax is extreme , that we know . The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams , what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels . Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château ( whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve , and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath , by the way ) . But he suddenly ' snaps ' completely when he discovers that his deceased father , a famous diplomat , had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience . This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair , expressionless face , and little ability to speak French coherently . Depardieu then transforms himself into a ' class hero ' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption , and lives in squalor and extreme poverty , while scorning a vast inheritance . He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister , which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people , though I have no objection to it , as I think people are far too hysterical about sex , especially in America , where apparently it never happens . The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful , if depressing , hyper-melodrama . The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are ( 1 ) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker , and ( 2 ) he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful , if harrowing , extreme emotional condition , whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background . Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous , but I don't agree . I believe Carax was genuine , and was not making an exploitation picture at all . It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who , for all I know , may be a complete madman , but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement .
Remember Greg the Bunny ? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel , but got turned into a full blown sitcom on Fox . My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny , beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on TV-PG material . Puppets Who Kill occurs in a similar universe , where puppets live in the same world as people , and like us , take on jobs and lives of their own . Let's just say if you couldn't handle that , then don't bother watching PWK , as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse , hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half-way house . There's plenty of violence , sex , and bad language ( so it would never make its way to U . S . Network TV ) . As if sociopathic puppets weren't enough , the fact that this takes place in Canada makes it even more disturbing ( btw , the government pays for this ) , and I think any American television viewer would demand more demented cable TV fodder like this . I don't know where you can get it in the U . S . , beyond extra satellite Tv , but I'd advise you give it a try . Really funny stuff . ( It airs on the Comedy Network in Canada )
I've got to say , I'm a big fan of these ' Last House on the Left ' rip-offs , even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me ; but one of these sorts of films that I didn't like much was Aldo Lado's ' Night Train Murders ' , and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don't mix , as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off . Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character ; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates , not one of them steps up and becomes this villain , leaving the lacking in the most important area . It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board . This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store , but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set . From there , the trio end up ' taking over ' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women . < br / > < br / > It has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film , which will be pleasing to many viewers ; but there's hardly any blood . Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes , and he may have gotten away with it too ; if he could film a brutal sex scene . The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex , as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time , and despite one very tame ' sandwich ' sequence , none of the sex is particularly interesting . Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes , this becomes a massive problem . Films like this are often lacking in style , suspense and credibility ; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you . As you might expect , none of the acting is up to anything ; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish . The direction is lacking in style , and there's very little tension or suspense ; making it difficult to care what is going to happen . Overall , this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film , and I can't recommend it .
Everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS . Although the film is completely fictional , it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin John Holmes . < br / > < br / > In Southern California in 1977 , Eddie Adams ( Mark Wahlberg ) is working as a busboy in a nightclub . One of the regular customers is pornographer Jack Horner ( Burt Reynolds ) and two of his starlets , Amber Waves ( Julianne Moore ) and Rollergirl ( Heather Graham ) . Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is well ... a little ... gifted . < br / > < br / > So Eddie stars in Jack's films under the pseudonym of " Dirk Diggler . " He becomes a " big " porno star ( no pun intended ) and seems to be on top of everything . Then comes the 80s when video replaces film and Jack's porno empire begins to collapse , along with Dirk Diggler and everybody else working in the field . < br / > < br / > BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well-filmed drama . There is a little bit of violence , but P . T . Anderson makes it more stylized . And it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography , especially when VHS became the standard medium for making pornos . < br / > < br / > A lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced . William H . Macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films , whose wife keeps having sex with everybody . I especially liked Don Cheadle's role as Buck the stereo salesman . The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds . A 90s classic !
Stealing is a crime , and these guys , Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it . I haven't even seen this film , but not only do i know it sucks , but the fact that it steals the story of another film , or 2 films for that matter , is such bull crap ( and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap ) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all . O . k that's a little much but stealing is worse . < br / > < br / > Ever seen Pontypool ? It was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008 , this radio host goes into work , and then this zombie attack happens . We only see what's going on inside the radio station , and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky Ken Loney ( easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind ) and the BBC calling in for an update on the situation . From all the reviews I've read , and from the conversation I had with my friend ( who has seen this film and Pontypool ) this film was exactly like it in the story , with minor tweaks here and there . So throw originality and creativity out the window . As for the Zombies , or the infected , whatever you want to call them . They are the exact same thing , just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly , and have a never ending quench for flesh . They are Zombies . ZOMBIES ! ! < br / > < br / > ZOMBIES ! ! ! Okay one to many , but back to this crappy movie . The Zombies from what I've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 Days Later , another better movie , with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh . This is where Zombie movies define themselves , story does not matter in a zombie movie ( as long as your not taking the idea of another film ) . Sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story , as is the case with Pontypool , but the zombies have to be , in a way , original . 28 Days Later started the insane raging Zombie . Pontypool I can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film . The Evil Dead , I think all i have to do is just type the name again because , come on it's The Evil Dead . Romero is the master , and he went through all different types of zombies , from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in Diary of the Dead , and he did each one with his own unique style . < br / > < br / > So , after talking about other great zombie movies , I think it's about time I explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it . This movie down right steals the original story outline to Pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing , yet in Hollywood it's allowed , and apparently approved of . This is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie , and just tries to tell it differently . The 90 ' s is like the worst period for movies ever , sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't , and it's because all the movies were the exact same . My favorite , the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end . They force feed you one suspect , make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him , then , bam , all this time it was this guy , you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue , say " hey guys , what did i miss ? " OH ! DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING DID YA ! Well , I'll leave a cliché as my closing statement . This is one film you'll surely want to miss .
Man , the ' 90 ' s really were an horrible decade for movies . The movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking . < br / > < br / > This 6th entry into the long running Halloween-series is certainly a bad one . You just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build-up movie . < br / > < br / > It's simply a poorly done film , that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it . Dr . Loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it . It's a real shame that this had to be Donald Pleasence last film-role . It's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an Halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one . < br / > < br / > There is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers just never comes across as threatening or scary . Perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie , from pretty early on already . He does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality . Also the attempts to uncover Myer's past don't really work out , for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well . It's obvious that the script went through various re-writes before - and also very possibly during filming . Several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing . < br / > < br / > The movie more often looks and feels like a made for TV one . This is also due to the lack of some real good gore . As an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch . < br / > < br / > So far the worst out of the series ! < br / > < br / > 3/10
It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the " thief " was obvious . It was a poor man's ( not to mention high school ) " Less than Zero " . I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add . So many issues are left unresolved , and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible . The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own . Avoid this movie , and watch something else about rich teen angst . I'm sure there are plenty of others to watch . Don't waste your time on this .
Just saw this movie on opening night . I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it ... I must say , I was not impressed . I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money . < br / > < br / > First of all " The Messengers " is very predictable , and just not much of a thriller . It might be scary for someone under 13 , but it really did nothing for me . The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution . < br / > < br / > Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial . Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes . < br / > < br / > If you've seen previews for this movie , then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot . This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters .
This is without a doubt the STUPIDEST movie of all time . < br / > < br / > I don't know who I'm angrier at--the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap ! ! < br / > < br / > I can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna-be movie . < br / > < br / > All of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot , and the acting is the worst I have ever seen in any movie-EVER ! ! < br / > < br / > There is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person , in fact I don't think they even had a script , they just made up everything as they went along--and you can tell . < br / > < br / > The " women " ( i . e . men dressed up in drag trying to look like women ) in the costumes looked so ridiculous , I guess they were trying to be sexy but--NOT SO MUCH ! ! Especially that old woman-disgusting . < br / > < br / > There is nothing scary about this movie , the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it . < br / > < br / > No brain required for watching this , you must be a total loser to want to see this movie . < br / > < br / > Don't forget - - I WARNED YOU ! ! !
One of Keli McCarthy's best . This movie is filled with sex , and nudity . It has gorgeous , sexy women and some sexy settings . < br / > < br / > Believe me , there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women . We have outside settings , a hot tub , beds of course , and some other nice places to have sex . < br / > < br / > Monique Parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl . Keli is amazing , she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes . My favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that . She has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out ! Renee Rea also has a sexy sex scene where again , she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies . < br / > < br / > The most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending . It's a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex , intense sex ! and Kelli McCarthy receiving it REAL hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted . The scene is long , steamy , VERY explicit , and fun . My favorite from 2001 . < br / > < br / > The other good scenes include Keli getting it on the woods ( really kinky ); then dressed as a bride . < br / > < br / > Renne Rea , always super gorgeous , dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene . Nice ! < br / > < br / > Please , watch this movie if you enjoy b-soft core sex . It's among the best from the new millennium . I had a blast with it .
In case you're wondering the buffoonish Loren C * * * n of ( Cryptozoology Inafame ) is a living idiot and any information he's provided is to be tossed out with the trash . The guy simply is a news paper clipper . < br / > < br / > As for the story line it was was a predictable train wreck , the actors were mechanical , the lighting was awful , and the props / clothing was cheap . < br / > < br / > Bobcat Goldwait should have starred over the clowns in this film . I was physically ill after seeing ten minutes of it . < br / > < br / > There are insane / retarded monkeys still in charge of films I see . < br / > < br / > Dan
Classe Tous Risques ( The Big Risk ) is a French gangster movie that doesn't try for style . That's why it has style . Because the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact , it becomes more and more involving . And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura , we wind up emotionally invested in this taciturn , tough killer who loves his wife and kids , has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect , and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint . We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small boys , one about 9 and one 4 . < br / > < br / > " This man was Abel Davos , sentenced to death in absentia , " we're told . " On the run for years , he had watched his resources dwindle , even as his anxiety kept him on the move . With the Italian police closing in each day , France was again his best bet . Maybe he'd been forgotten . " < br / > < br / > Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends . That was several years ago . A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong . Now he's hiding out with his two kids . He calls his friends in Paris to help him out . He and his kids need to get from Nice to Paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up roadblocks . For Davos ' two best friends , time has passed and they've moved on . They don't want to put themselves at risk , and for what ? Obligation gives may to caution . So they hire a young thief , Eric Stark ( Jean - Paul Belmondo ) , to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance , then to drive to Paris with Davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden . We're on a journey where Davos ' options are increasingly limited , where he must find ways to have his children cared for , where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship , where betrayal seems likely , and where quite possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark . < br / > < br / > This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about . There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars , no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors have loved . Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos , a man who once was somebody , who now is sliding down to be nobody , and who reacts with violence and resignation . < br / > < br / > Lino Ventura dominates the movie , yet when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry happens . Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons . He is humiliated by his situation . He is a tough man who sees killing someone , if needed , as just part of the business he's in . Belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on , provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator . Belmondo was 27 and looks younger . His unlikely star power as a lead actor - - broken nose , under-slung jaw - - shines right off the screen . He makes Erik a match for Ventura when they share a scene . And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane ( Sandra Milo ) , the young woman who becomes his girl friend , radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal . The ending is bittersweet fate , and without a stylistic posture in sight . We hear Davos say , " Abel's gone . There's nothing left . " It would be well worth watching Classe tous Risques to learn what he means . < br / > < br / > There are many fine French gangster films . I'd place this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur . To see one of Lino Ventura's finest performances , watch Army of Shadows .
If you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through . There just wasn't anything good to say about it at all . So what's different with the second one ? Why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched ? This one doesn't take itself too seriously . It knows it was made for TV and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue . There are moments where it tries to get ' serious ' or ' intense ' but these moments are so corny you have to laugh . < br / > < br / > Thankfully gone are any elements of Uwe Boll and any hint that this originated from a video game ( other than the title of course ) . Don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp , lame zombie movies , or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie . Take two shots whenever Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother ! Take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest ! etc etc .
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments . This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world . Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film . Mantan Moreland , ( Jeff ) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention . I hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment . If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula throughout many films during the 1940 ' s , you just might like to watch John doing his best .
I like CKY and Viva La Bam , so I couldn't resist this when I saw it for £ 1.99 in Gamestation . It is Bam Magera's debut scripted film , penned by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo , and stars the entire CKY crew ( Ryan Dunn , Raab Himself , Rake Yohn , Jenn Rivell , Don Vito etc etc ) . Brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - its quite CKYish in its colour style - but also shows progression . < br / > < br / > Basically it follows ( very loosely ) Ryan Dunn's break up with girlfriend Glauren ( played by Jenn ) . Vilo ( played by Bam , named after Vilo Valo by any chance ? ) and Falcone ( Bran ) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts . < br / > < br / > Its a bit like the CKY films but with a linear storyline ( which is very basic indeed ) and poor acting . Its strange , the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next . < br / > < br / > The acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part , but the second half of the film is much better than the first ( 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though ) , and there are a number of redeeming factors , such as Tony Hawk's cameo , Dicimaillo's sub plots such as ' The Futurstic Invention Awards ' and ' The Diamond Bike ' , the soundtrack is also very strong ( its not ALL cKy and HIM - in fact Bomfunk MC's steal the film in terms of its use of music ) . In the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in . < br / > < br / > The film will appeal to those who like the CKY antics , but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit . Oh , and will someone tell Bam that skating montages , especially in films , is sooo 1998 . < br / > < br / > However , the best part of the package on the DVD is not the film - but the 40 mins ' Making Of ' doc . < br / > < br / > The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab Himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly ( as usual Bam comes across as a bit of a dick , especially towards Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy ) . The last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend ( who is an infrequent CKY member ) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the Magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang ( espcially Ape and Ryan ) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull DVD . < br / > < br / > For £ 1.99 I'm very satisified - although I hope Bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on .
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts . The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful . The story is also both funny and poignant at times . < br / > < br / > People who like European films and " art movies " will like this movie . This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it . Go rent it . < br / > < br / >
Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack . But , there are legitimate reasons for it . ( 1 ) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film BUT he didn't like the script , wanted to change it , his request was denied , so he didn't do the film . ( 2 ) It was low budget , Bill Murray had grown to superstar status . Ted Knight passed away in 1986 , and Chevy Chase the " so called ace " of the first movie ( although it was Rodney all the way ) couldn't't be on more than 5 minutes , because it would cost too much to pay him . BUT you had Dan Aykroyd , Robert Stack , Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason , all serviceable substitutes , who none had their best performances .
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film . Our obsession with what is , or should be , regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the ' guidance ' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many , many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past . So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term ' soft ' and ' hard ' porn , with both carrying the same pornography label . It is time for us all recognise that neither the R rated ( soft porn ? ) release version of this film , nor the unrated version ( hard porn ? ) available on DVD were in any way pornographic . < br / > < br / > In legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt . Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover , Fanny Hill , Women in Love , The Story of ' O ' or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content , tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition , but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation , and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line , but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography . Although the Hayes code would have rated AIW as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities , in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment , it cannot be regarded as pornographic ( this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic , only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment ) . In AIW , we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing , and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do . After he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her , she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a Wonderland ( closely based on that of Lewis Carrol ) where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs . She is shocked , but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them , so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away . She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair , but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored , and the film ends with them living ' happily ever after ' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog - an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart . < br / > < br / > Pornographic ? - Hardly ! . < br / > < br / > Suitable viewing for children ? - Well probably not quite , unless they have very progressive parents . < br / > < br / > R rating ? - PG would be more appropriate today . < br / > < br / > Entertaining for viewers in most age groups ? - Yes , but the film has its faults - these are discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb , however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it . < br / > < br / > I believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti-pornography activist of " scientific proof " that a magazine picture of Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models . These and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress , but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic , Several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD format ; the last was a DVD containing both the R rated and unrated versions of the film , released by Subversive Cinema in 2007 . Copies of this were readily available until a few months ago , now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price - a situation which usually quickly results in a new DVD release appearing . This continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status . < br / > < br / > Commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting - my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self-censorship recommendations originating with the Hayes Committee . On this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as ' not helpful ' and I seldom make them ; but fortunately I still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying . It is flawed , but Kristine deBell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience . Overall I would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next DVD edition if and when it appears . If Ms deBell is still alive today I would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved .

When I rented this movie , I half expected it to be a low budget , plot less Indy film , but thought I'd give it a try . I started watching Part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later . It was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time . From the writing to the directing to the performances , I was laughing , crying , and singing all the way through Nan Astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood . Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this film . I had never heard of her before , but now I will forever remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance . She , Keeley Hawes , and Jodhi May are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality . The fact that the film is set in the 1890 ' s not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period , but makes a statement about our society today . You must see this film and , probably like myself , you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection .
Set in 1945 , Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin . Unfortunately for everyone around him , he's a walking disaster , causing mayhem everywhere he goes . The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife ( who's also on the train ) , a soldier on his way home , two gay elderly gentlemen , an angry train conductor , two nuns , a bunch of refugees , and even more people . < br / > < br / > Meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller ( which it does quite well - at least to begin with ) , and comedy , the film fails with both . It doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene . And as the train races towards its final destination , the film turns more and more bizarre , ending on a truly surreal note . < br / > < br / > The good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters . Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors , no matter how small the part is . It feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film . Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script ( act your lines - don't read them ! ) . < br / > < br / > The comedy is more or less slapstick , with the same jokes repeated over and over . The pace is incredibly slow at times ( quite often , actually ) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason . The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue . The film looks great though , in moody B & W , but it's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department . [ 1/10 ]
There is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie . It's just terribly dull . Dull is the photography - - - the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out . Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm , dunno . Dull is the script , which is tedious and ' Jules Pfeiffer'-ish . That is , kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool . Like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight . The ' slice-of-life ' characters were mostly annoying . True , they were real to life , but hey , if I wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things , I'd just watch myself . I wouldn't trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid , and an evening , watching someone else do it . < br / > < br / > I expected a funny , bright rom-com . What I got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera . < br / > < br / > I gave this a 4 out 10 , because it appears that someone tried , at least .
This movie is sweet - not cloying , just warm-spirited and kind . I found it only mildly funny , and the premise * is * wildly improbable , but the characters are so charming ( especially Minnie Driver's ) that they had my full attention right from the beginning , and soon had my affection too . < br / > < br / > Bonnie Hunt has done a great job in her directing debut , and a good job with the writing as well . I highly recommend this movie and will see it again , I'm sure .
I watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising young talents in movies was going . Unfortunately , with this movie , Leelee Sobieski has chosen a path not only well worn , but completely free of any meaningful destination . This movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen , tap you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heartstrings so that it may give them a good tug . Romance can be done well , and when it is , the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen . During the emotional climax of this movie , I laughed . Heartily . To save you the time and money , I would suggest , instead of seeing this movie , you have a meal of Karo syrup and Velveeta . It's about the same .
First , the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading , the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker , who plans to kill them all . They stop at a small motel , where he holds them hostage , but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls . Violence ensues . < br / > < br / > I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie " The Hitcher " . Not that The Hitcher is any better , and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway , but this was almost unbearable at times . I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this . < br / > < br / > I can't even count how many movies I've seen with virtually the same storyline , so this was almost painfully predictable at times , but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example . At one point a door is covered in ( what is very obviously ) blood , and two police officers , at the scene because of a 911 call , are looking at it from 30 feet away , see a man , also covered in blood , walk out of the door , agree that it looks suspicious , but decide to not investigate further . < br / > < br / > But , however ridiculous it may be , the movie was never boring , was well produced , directed , and acted , complete with good special effects , gratuitous nudity , and violence . I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie , but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement . Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies , and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching .
I just watched this film this morning and I found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith . Babette gave them another way to look at life ; not a replacement , but an enhancement . She shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her . I see the story of God in here . He sent his only son to man . Man could not possibly give anything that would equal that . So , for our small sacrifice , we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it . In this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of God . Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense . The love that God's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it . Even the film is a metaphor . It seems slow in the beginning , but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end . It was truly a feast .
It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80 ' s generation who grew up loving those loopy John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland , and while I prefer there other more bizarre , out-there flick , Better Off Dead , it's hard for me to dislike One Crazy Summer , a movie I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens . OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead , returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that film . < br / > < br / > Cusack is Hoops , following graduation pal Joel Murray ( George ) to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach . Hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde , buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium . One of the homes , needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore ( Cassandra ) . There's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's home ( .. he had recently passed ) , but it has been won by Teddy over the past many years , and Hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water . But , with the help and motivation of newfound Nantucket friends ( .. such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers ! ) , George , and budding love-interest Cassandra , perhaps Hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood . Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky , manic weapons salesman , General Raymond ( .. SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspired bit of casting ) , Ack , who uses the training from his father to assist Hoops and company in their goals to win the race . < br / > < br / > Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting stuck in a Godzilla suit ( ! ) running rampant across an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted ( Mark Metcalf , barely recognizable as Teddy's rather unhinged pops ) ' s condominium , Hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid , George a victim of toxic flatulence , Bruce Wagner's nutty Uncle Frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show , and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal ! Jeremy Piven as ( you guessed it ) a brutish jerk who associates with Teddy and causes trouble for Hoops and his posse , the yummy Kimberly Foster as Cookie ( .. Teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with Hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father ) , and the one-and-only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted , who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race . Demi Moore is cute , but this is Cusack's vehicle , though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes their in . Again , some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie ( Hoops is an artist , appropriately ) . If you like his movies , I highly recommend the underrated , How I Got Into College .
" Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year . The first film was cute , cuddly and charming . The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched , but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept . Even the human story had some explanation to it . Josh's father was killed in a plane crash , so he is sad . And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well . < br / > < br / > Now for the poorly made sequel . It is terrible . This is the worst kind of bad sequel , the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones . The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way , this time , the K - 9 plays football instead of basketball . No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter , benefit of a doubt , walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this , there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making . < br / > < br / > The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh , who is in eight grade . He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb . In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident , which the audience can relate to , most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one . < br / > < br / > In this movie , the emotional plot is a bit more complicated . Josh's mother is dating once again . He and Buddy , his dog who can play basketball , don't like this at all . Why ? If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life , especially one this nice . The man's name is Patrick Sullivan , and Josh's mother , Jackie , met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy . < br / > < br / > The animal story is too simple . Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team , the Timber Wolves . The team itself looks like something from America's Funniest Home Videos , the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other . So when Bud shows up one day , he proves he can play as a receiver for them , and is no doubt the team's best player . < br / > < br / > Buddy's extremely cute in his football costume . Oh , he is enough to melt the heart . The dog is the best in this movie as well . Too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team . < br / > < br / > There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals , of course they try to catch Buddy . But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a " Home Alone " scenario to them . < br / > < br / > " Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " is much more goofy than the first too . The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that , I have to admit made me laugh , at the stupidity of it all . There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football . < br / > < br / > The performances were also quite the embarrassment . I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations , but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D + . Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic . < br / > < br / > There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers , but that isn't even worth mentioning . Will children enjoy this movie ? Perhaps , but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep . They will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in , and loath over the fast changing script , and protest against the boring performances , and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al " Air Bud , " as I did . < br / > < br / > I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable .
I was surprised , " Once More , My Darling " , had not generated enough votes ( at this writing ) for a " user rating " . It's a " screwy " comedy I have enjoyed many times over the years . Robert Montgomery's mission places him in some very improbable situations , and he's just the man for the job . He maintains his trademark " befuddled " look throughout the film and hysterically , too . Ann Blyth plays his precocious / eccentric pursuer , who assumes a relationship that does not exist . Her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname " Killer " , but remains cute and cuddly . < br / > < br / > Among the glut of " B " movies from the late 1940 ' s and 1950 ' s , " Once More , My Darling " is a standout . This one is worth looking for ...
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny . On the other hand , Hi De Hi , you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny . I have just purchased the second set of the series , ( series 3 - 4 ) and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again . I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors ( or the many unseen crew members ) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait . The gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves . Croft and Perry created some pure gold some of which shines through Hi De Hi .
I have seen this movie since I was a little girl , and being from New York and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories . This movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person , woman , and provider Claudine attempted to be . It was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation . It was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat . Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role , and it was well deserved . If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments , enjoy Claudine . Your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind , and understand the overall frustration .
When I sat down in the cinema to see this I was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue-in-cheek action film , which had been implied by the trailers . However , it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more . < br / > < br / > Normally , I don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible . For instance , this film tries to mix action with comedy , romance , lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once . Most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films ( just look at Batman Forever ) but I was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case , they pulled it off . < br / > < br / > The end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers . ( However , the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes . ) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull of a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does a excellent villain . This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch . < br / > < br / > However , the big let-down here for me is that in having ' The Gentleman Highwayman ' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs . Okay , so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent British films ; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts .
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooo much ! ! ! It is so incredible ... I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult . It is my favorite Disney movie of alll time ! You should watch it , watch it and love it . My friends and I watch it a ton ... It is sooo good . I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart . My favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the strays and Thomas O'Malley . The writers / producers / director completely nailed this one ... yeah , nailed it to the wall . < br / > < br / > xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
Admittedly , I watched the MST 3K version of this , but it's not actually too bad outright , at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred . < br / > < br / > The story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a " reform school " called Girls ' Town . Along way , races , redemption , and wackiness ( unintentional ) happen . The story and acting are a little flat , as is the action . However , the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored . < br / > < br / > Overall , just a simple sub par 50 ' s flick , but far from the worst movie ever made , with some bright spots in the movie ( The Ave Maria sequence was good for me ) . < br / > < br / > If you get a chance to watch the MST 3K version , you won't be disappointed . By it self , not so much , but I can think of worse methods of torture ( " Spiker " anyone ? ) .
During the 13 years of schooling I had from Kindergarten through high school , there was only one day that my class took a field trip . When I went to school , you went to school , from 8: 30 until 3:30 and filed trips were not taken . But , for some reason I could not recall at this advanced age , we went to see a movie - National Velvet . I do not recall the movie , so , on the eve of my 57th year , I decided to revisit it . < br / > < br / > It is a movie about a time that no longer exists . A time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses . A time when people were given the benefit of the doubt . It was a time when family was the most important thing . This film shows all of that and more . It shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people . < br / > < br / > It would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message . < br / > < br / > It was a treat to see the young Elizabeth Taylor , Mickey Rooney at his best , the Academy Award-winning performance of Anne Revere , Angela Lansbury before Murder , She Wrote , and Donald Crisp , who performed for almost sixty years . < br / > < br / > What a movie !
Stay away from this movie . Far away . Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow . Every performance is flat and unfeeling , except Fondacaro's . The plot is a simple one , and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible . A group of high-school kids go to a carnival , see a side-show , and get in over their heads . < br / > < br / > Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned , this is not like any of his other films . This one is lacking in all departments ( humor , sex , horror , etc . ) other F . O . Ray movies excell in . < br / > < br / > The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry , in which the director makes comments like " We had a limited budget " and " with our limited timeline " which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film . Go rent " Droid Runner " ( Fred Olen Ray ) or " The Dead Hate the Living " ( Full Moon ) instead . Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves ( and that's saying a lot after seeing " Killer Eye " ) < br / > < br / > Grade : D -
This movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome . I just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it . The acting was very good , hot women and some scary parts . It is plain and simply worth the money to pay for .
First , let me start off by saying this film SOUNDED very interesting : A serial killer copycatting the works of Edgar Allan Poe ( who is one of my writers of all time ) . Sounds cool , right ? Yeah , definitely not . Probably the worst film I've ever seen . Ever . And that's not an exaggeration . I've seen a lot of very , very bad movies . This one takes the cake . And I was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it . < br / > < br / > Perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure : If you have the name of the killer , his entire life's history , a criminal record , and HIS ADDRESS , where is the first place you should look ? Hmm . . . possibly . . . his house ? What ? ! NO ! That's a preposterous idea , Anthony ! How could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley ? * spoilers end * Honestly , sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad , or vice versa . . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find . < br / > < br / > I think my biggest pet peeve was how the police / FBI acted . < br / > < br / > For example : Black FBI Agent : " Okay , endangered female , just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be . Sound good to you ? " Moronic Female FBI Agent : " Yeah , sounds a-okay to me . Go right ahead . I'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter . " Black FBI Agent : " Excellent , that's what I would do ! " Honestly , if you want to be in law enforcement , rent this movie so you can learn how not to act . . . or if you're a human and want to learn the same . < br / > < br / > 0.5 / 10 : A half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores . Congrats . < br / > < br / > - AP3 -
This is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while . An eerie abandon house , interesting characters , gore and a twisted plot . Who could ask for anything more in a horror movie ? It is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so I won't hold that against it . The music , camera angles and so forth are excellent . The sets are well make and very convincing . There was pretty much no subplots however , it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow ... To be scared ... This one keeps it pretty simple and does just that . If I were to compare it to any other movie I would say it reminded me of the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Definitely a horror movie lover must see .
This film isn't a comedy , its an expose . I've always hated dog shows , considering the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them . Hence , the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film . I get a kick out of something being taken so seriously , even though the gains are small and insignificant . It's like miniature golf , or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record . The acting was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman , and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters , who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous . Eugene Levy was great , as was Michael McKean and Fred Willard . However , it was the dogs who eventually stole the show . But then again , who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway .
How can you make a joke about Mafia ? It is not the kind of subject to laugh at ! A near movie cannot make me laugh , because I am comparing it to Jane Austen's Mafia ! . Mafia ! wasn't a good movie but Hoods is really worse ! In Mafia ! , there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile . Not too bad actors but very bad scenario ! ! We sure prefer something serious like The Godfather . I give it * out of * * * .
Spoilers in this review ! Despite a few highly improbable scenes , including the boys in PE measuring their penises in a contest and the few obligatory teens-trying-to-get-laid vignettes , this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done . It achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends , Gary , Dave , Rick , as smoking , drinking , ever on the prowl teens , but also dwells on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their loyalties tested . This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends . For the shy romantic Gary , when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time he falls instantly in love . The awakening emotion in Gary is writ large on the screen , and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is jilted by her lover . This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence , as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested , and broken , over the course of the story . The confident ladies man , Rick , is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were : handsome , cool , and always has the impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon . Rick turns out to be a cad , but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old . He panics and makes a bad decision . From Rick's perspective , the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams , a bad breakup , and then at the end reconciling . The look on Rick's face as Gary walks in and sees Karen kissing Rick , shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman . As in real life , you don't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love . This is the tragedy of the film . Rick is no villain , and constantly through the film he reminds Gary and Dave that they're his best friends . The soulful quality of Gary's performance , however , is the heart of the story . Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser . He does everything right , his heart's in the right place , and he's consumed by love for Karen . Yet , Karen , in the end , is not moved by Gary's devotion and kindness . Karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back , who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others . This film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship , but that's what makes it unique among teen films . It ceases being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film , albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion . Anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her , will understand . The heartrending crushes of high school are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood , and this film will remind you of that in bold strokes . Gary's final reversal , as he drives away with the inscribed locket , is as poignant a moment as any in cinema . One feels , after watching this , that it's really made of two movies . The first part is a silly teen sexploitation film , and once the story begins , it's a strongly affecting drama . A terrific movie . It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including The Police , The Cars , Devo , Oingo Boingo , The Plimsouls , The Waitresses , Gleaming Spires , and Phil Seymour .
An odd , willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry . Instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife ( Sienna Miller ) and childhood love ( Keira Knightley ) . Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet . < br / > < br / > The film never seems to decide on where it's going . There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other . Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads ( who wouldn't ! ? ) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them . Miller is the choice of the two ( I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic ) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent Welsh accents . Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William ( Murphy ) , arty production ( eg double crossfades ) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend . 4/10
I am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but IMDb does't have zero as rating option ... worst movie i have ever watched .. Story of the movie 1 . Predator ship crashes on earth 2 . One alien and some face huggers are released and they start killing humans . 3 . One predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans . 4 . Then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human , aliens and predator . 5 . Some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator . 6 . The End Directors should consider refunding money back to the viewers . If still you want to watch this movie , download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money .. all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth , you see just dark shadows even in action scenes .. too much violence .. I didn't expect it from a fox movie
The 1970s are often regarded as a golden age of British television comedy , a period which saw numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows such as " Monty Python's Flying Circus " . The period was , however , emphatically not a golden age of British film comedy , and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen . The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons , but their best films ( " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " and " Life of Brian " ) were very different in conception to their TV show . < br / > < br / > The main problem with adapting sitcoms for the cinema is that concepts devised to fit the BBC's 30 minute slots ( 25 minutes on ITV , which has to find room for commercials ) do not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four times as long . Few people will remember the film versions of , say , " Up Pompeii ! " or " Steptoe and Son " with the same affection as the television versions . In the case of many classic TV comedy shows ( " Some Mothers Do ' Ave ' Em " , " Yes , Minister " , " Fawlty Towers " , " The Goodies " ) no attempt was made to film them at all , for which we can be grateful . Characters such as Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleese's Basil Fawlty can be hilarious in half-hour doses , but I doubt if they would remain as funny over two hours . One comedy programme ( albeit a dramatisation of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense ) which might have worked in the cinema was " The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin " , but any hopes of a film were dashed by the tragically early death of its star Leonard Rossiter . < br / > < br / > " Dad's Army " was one of the few television sitcoms of the period which was turned into a decent film . ( About the only other one I can think of was " Porridge " ) . This was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them . The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the misadventures of a Home Guard platoon in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea . ( The Home Guard , initially known as the Local Defence Volunteers , was an auxiliary militia during World War II made up , for the most part , of men too old to serve in the regular forces ) . The film version is a three-act drama . Act I deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members . In Act II they cause havoc during an Army training exercise . In Act III they succeed in capturing a group of Nazi airmen whose plane has been shot down . < br / > < br / > The three key players in this drama are the platoon's commander , Captain George Mainwaring ( Arthur Lowe ) , and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson ( John Le Mesurier ) and Corporal Jack Jones ( Clive Dunn ) . Mainwaring , who in civilian life is the local bank manager , is a fussy little man , peering at the world through a pair of thick spectacles . It is he who takes the initiative in forming the Home Guard unit and who appoints himself its commander . He is pompous , officious , with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own powers of leadership , the sort of man who does not suffer fools gladly . ( And in George Mainwaring's world-view the term " fool " covers most of the rest of the human race ) . He does , however , have his good qualities . He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage , shown in his encounter with the Germans . < br / > < br / > Wilson is Mainwaring's deputy at the bank . The two men are very different in character , something emphasised by a difference in appearance , Wilson being tall and thin whereas Mainwaring is short and stout . He comes across as being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss . ( His accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy ) . Nevertheless , he has ended up playing second fiddle both in civilian and military life , probably because he has the sort of passive personality which leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take anything altogether seriously . Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher's shop . ( His promotion to Corporal is due mainly to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages ) . His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos . Although his catchphrase is " Don't panic ! " he is prone to panicking at any given opportunity . < br / > < br / > Several other members of the platoon are featured . Private Fraser , the dour Scottish undertaker , is even more of a pessimist than Wilson . ( Catchphrase : " We're doomed , man , DOOMED ! " ) . Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the whereabouts of the nearest lavatory . Private Walker is a sharp Cockney spiv and Private Pike ( another bank employee ) a spoilt mummy's boy . ( Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress , although Wilson tries to keep this liaison secret from the disapproving Mainwaring ) . Two significant outsiders are the mild-mannered Vicar and the ARP warden , Mainwaring's detested enemy and quite his equal in pompousness and officiousness . < br / > < br / > There are occasional bawdy doubles entendres ( " Keep your hands off my privates " - Mainwaring is ostensibly referring to those soldiers who hold that rank ) , more so than in the television show which was surprisingly free of innuendo . ( Its creators , David Croft and Jimmy Perry , would later go on to create comedy shows such as " Are You Being Served ? " and " Hi-de-hi " which were notorious for suggestive humour ) . The film does , however , preserve much of the mixture of gentle wit , nostalgia and sharp characterisation which made the TV series so successful . 7/10
Liv Tyler . Liv Tyler . Liv Tyler . Yeah it's hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty ( giving an radiantly picture-perfect performance ) , as she simply has tongues wagging . ' One Night at McCool's ' is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old-fashion shades tied in to its familiar , but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she's milking it to her advantage . When you see Tyler , no wonder why they are infatuated and would do anything that's anything to see ' her ' happy and living ' her ' dreams . Just like Tyler , there's something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of Matt Dillon , John Goodman , Paul Reiser ( who's great ) and especially Michael Douglas ( who plays the hired assassin with cool-ease , but a questionable hairdo ) really having a good time with their roles . The consuming plot opens up with the main three characters ( Dillon , Goodman and Reiser ) telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she's having on them to lead to an insane climax . There's an unpredictable chain of events ( ranging from fruity to sensual ) , where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic ( snowball ) twist of fate for the characters ( that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl ) . Howard Zwart's direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script's quick-fire gags and frenetically fun , if complicated situations . One of the best under-the-radar comedies in the last decade , which will have you under Tyler's thumb .
Bizarre . This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer , but everything that happens in this movie is fiction . I guess it tries to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus . In the movie , wolfman moves into the apartment above hers . She seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him . She puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman , and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings . Some of the wolfman's freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them . The whole thing is very bizarre . < br / > < br / > FINAL VERDICT : Nothing memorable . There is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman . I think you can find better films out there .
A tough sell : British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud , bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged , blustery , brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether . The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of " King Lear " ( during an Air Raid ! ) , yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation . Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit , whose dresser was Ronald Harwood , this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians . Unfortunately , Albert Finney ( at this point in his career , not at all elderly ) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor ; Finney ( and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates ) cannot modulate Sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us , so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice , and in the next he's curiously falling apart . With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude , one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss ( and his future ) , yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest . Courtenay , who played this part on stage ( and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor ) , is far more attuned to his role , and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film . These two , thankfully , do not peck at each other's heads , and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern ( which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act ); but , without a juxtaposition of servant vs . celebrity , there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism , the hint at what once was . * 1/2 from * * *
This early Warner Brothers talkie " Son of the Gods " ( 1930 ) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese . Chinese-Americans are treated like second-class citizens , and whites hold them in nothing but contempt . < br / > < br / > Prolific scenarist Bradley King based her screenplay on Rex Beach's novel about a young , impressionable Chinaman , Sam Lee ( Richard Barthelmess of " Only Angels Have Wings " ) , who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about Sam once they learn about his heritage . Sam goes to his father , Lee Ying ( E . Alyn Warren of " Gone With The Wind " ) , who is a wealthy Chinaman with offices not only in New York City but also in San Francisco . Sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave New York and go where he cannot be hurt by Americans . His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance . Sam has yet to learn this lesson . He refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to London , England , peeling potatoes while he is on board . < br / > < br / > During the trip , he encounters a British playwright , Bathurst ( Claude King of " Arrowsmith " ) , who needs some help writing a play about the Chinese . Sam and he strike up a friendship and Sam furnishes him with cultural information about Asians . While they are relaxing in France , Sam meets a beautiful young woman , Allana Wagner ( Constance Bennett of " Two-Faced Woman " ) , who falls madly in love with him . It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel . Everybody at the motel knows about Sam being a Chinaman with the exception of Allana . Sensitive about his racial heritage , Sam holds Allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him . They fall madly in love together . Allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that Sam is a Chinaman and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with coolies floods Allana's mind . She storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs Sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers . < br / > < br / > Of course , Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events . He thought that Allana loved him but she didn't . About this time , Sam's father Lee Ying falls tragically ill and Ying's secretary of sorts , Eileen ( Mildred Van Dorn of " Iron Man " ) sends Sam a telegram about Ying's illness . Predictably , Sam rushes home to New York to be at his father's side . Since his public humiliation , Sam has vowed to show no kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans ; Eileen is an Irish-Catholic and probably one of his few white friends . Lee Ying dies and Sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-White racism , until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundling that a San Francisco cop on the beat gave to Lee Ying and his wife to bring up . The cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take Sam away from the Yings . Sam learns this revelation about the same time that Allana comes to New York and falls ill . During her illness , she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see Sam and requests that Sam visit her in order to help her recover . Unbeknownst to Allana , Sam does visit her and she improves , but she has no memory of his visit , merely a hazy notion . Eventually , Allana learns the truth about Sam not being a Chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after . < br / > < br / > This socially conscientious Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise . The reconciliation between Allana and Sam stretches credibility , despite their self-professed undying love for each other . However , in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it , they wind up in each other's arms . < br / > < br / > The capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that Sam isn't Chinese damages some of the film's moral power . Incredibly , " Son of the Gods " is a Pre-Code film that almost seems prudish ; for example , Sam is an American , not Chinese ! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips Sam with her riding crop . Claude King is good as Bathurst , and E . Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying . Interestingly , Warren made a career out of portraying Asian characters . Richard Barthelmess is flawless as Sam ; he delivers a highly nuanced performance . Despite its age , " Son of the Gods " is a son of a good movie !
OK , what to say about Actium Maximus ... < br / > < br / > There are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle ' round to awesome . There are bad movies that just suck in their own right . There are good movies , and so-so movies , and movies that are just fun . Then there's Actium Maximus . You can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment . This particular movie is worse than Turkish Star wars one and the sequel too . Those movies are so bad they circle ' round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober . Actium circles ' round from bad to awesome , but then it doesn't stop there , it takes another trip to badville , then ' round again to awesome , then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of " Bad " and " stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently . " If you are into self punishment this movie is for you . It actually will cause your brain to hurt .
Two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts . Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this whodunnit from 1945 . Lots of fast talking , everybody yells at everybody , and the two page boys call the police detective " Marty " ( played by Ralph Sanford ) . It's a real " shortie " at 59 minutes , and it has the feel of being adapted from a play , since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage . We don't really care about any of the characters , which is probably why its hardly ever shown . No big deal . This was Phil Karlson's second film as director . We're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off , so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first . I'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers .
Why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty ? Well its deductive logic my friends , you see I know God exists because Satan does , how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film ? Yes there is no doubt about it , on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film . He what ? You wonder ; the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings , why would he waste his time in making you watch this film ? My only conclusion to that query is that Satan believes watching Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment , not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues , instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever . Can this film be as terrible as he says ? Yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times , maybe more . But maybe I am being too harsh , this film does have a few moments in it , the beginning for example , starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls ; now never being in a sorority I am unsure if girls really do this , but hey one can always pray . Now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college ; the girls themselves ( about eight in all ) are in an archaeological class , where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds . Flash forward the professor of the class ( who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently ) takes a handful of his nubile students , plus girlfriend , to a remote lake in the mountains , their quests , to find ancient Indian artifacts ; yeah right professor , we know what angle your pitching . Now this is where the movie gets going , the group of five , four girls , one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions , but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls , only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways . Moving on they get to a " campsite " consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong . First the prof . and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them , only to be captured by some unknown force . Continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers , plus one drunk guy , come looking for them , their plan , to rape the girls and do horrible things to them . The movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand ; but their is a hitch to this plan Mr . Druid , one of the girls is devirginized right before us , so away goes that plan . Now since I said there would be spoilers I'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you , the four girls get taken , drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed , after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof . come to save them ; they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says , " I think I can make it down there ! " only to leap down and break his leg . The prof . runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape-minded-now-heroic biker left to fend off the 6 ' 3 " giant druid . First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife , the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously . Afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick stretchers and ponder if everything is really over , only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives . In a nutshell that is the film and this is my review , which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years . Thankfully Satan can only get to some of us and not all . The Judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl at Circuit City I am going to let borrow this movie ; " I'm sorry Sheila , please don't hate me for letting you watch this . "
Charles Chaplin's ' Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 45 minutes in length , it was not quite a feature film . With World War One just drawing to a close , many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops , and Chaplin was no exception . And so the lovable Tramp went to war ! The film begins with the Tramp in training , and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills , including marching and gun-slinging , much to the disgust of his drill sergeant . The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches , faced with a more formidable foe , though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he . The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen German soldiers by " surrounding them " had me in stitches . < br / > < br / > There are plenty of other great moments in this film . Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious , as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface . < br / > < br / > However , the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree . The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers , unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy , as they are single-handedly disabled one-by-one are highly amusing , especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood . < br / > < br / > This is a very enjoyable film , and one of the best of Chaplin's pre - 1920 efforts . Highly recommended .
One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore , " Ten Cents a Dance " stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dance-hall girl " Barbara " in her sixth role . Stanwyck looks quite " plain-jane " in this one , and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager . Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton ( Ricardo Cortez ) who wants to sweep her off her feet . ( Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s . ) Then she meets Eddie , who's very different from the dashing Carlton . The writer , Jo Swerling , had worked on some biggies ( Its a Wonderful Life , Guys and Dolls , and Gone with the Wind ) so I was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary . The story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru , and is VERY similar to " The Bride Walks Out " from 1936 , ALSO starring Stanwyck ... T . B . W . O . is much more clever , but also more tame , due to on-slaught of the Hays code ...
It was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching . The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people . I was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as " Raging Bull " and " Goodfellas " in this movie A great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing .
This movie is so cool . It told me to enjoy every moment in life to its fulness . I think that Bonnie Hunt ( Jerry Maguire ) writes well and I am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie . That is really neat , in a society that worships wealth , health and youth , it was nice to see a movie about normal people . The movie reminded me a lot of " While you were Sleeping " which I really love . If you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills . < br / > < br / > Favorite Quotes : Megan Dayton : " I'm just saying , for safety , don't shave your legs , because then you definitely won't let it go too far . " Grace Briggs : " Megan , it's a first date . " Megan Dayton : " I married a first date . I'm sure you plan on being level-headed , but once you're in the moment , the male brain seems , I don't know , everything they say suddenly seems brilliant . Hairy legs are your only link to reality . " Favorite Scenes : Megan ( Good Will Hunting ) riding her bike . All the scenes in the garden . The conversation and comradery among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant . Please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart !
I just watch this move recently on Encore channel . What a great film , a great cast as well . Flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable . The movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement . Therefore Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life . Then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life . Then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for Randy steckle played by Olliver platt . Then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of God . David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about God . It's amazing to watch Julia Roberts along with Kevin Bacon , Oliver platt , William baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at such a prime time of their careers . One can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore . This is one of the best productions from Joel Schumacher . I really enjoy this movie .
Thank God for DVR and the high speed of it's fast forward . Even with that I couldn't sit through any more of that travesty . When they came across the old Indian asking for beans I gave up and erased it . Is this the best that SciFi Channel can come up with for Saturday nights ? How about some old classics instead ? The idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough . It seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods . What more can I say ? It was so awful that I don't think I can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it . But , it looks like one more line will do it . Save your time , let alone your money on this dog of a film .
An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive . I challenge anyone who is a " Aliens ( James Cameron 1986 ) " Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage . < br / > < br / > Cast members such as R . Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead " Jack Scalia " was really absolutely horrible . I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin . I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder . Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies . < br / > < br / > But on this movie : The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine " thriller " . It included such lines as " I got a bad feeling about this " and " Kill me " as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the " alien hop " just before it pops out of his stomach . There is also a rip-off of the classic " get some ! " via Bill Paxton . We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls . Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie " Aliens " . And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid ( as opposed to having acid for blood ) . There are many more major examples . So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens ( With Sigourney Weaver ) . You'll have a more enjoyable time . < br / > < br / > The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing . Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email . Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not . The whole command structure between crew and Capt . was poorly done . I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs . In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples ( like dive depth etc .. ) . < br / > < br / > If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you . As for me this one is going back on the shelf ... permanently .
I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time . The acting is fantastic and the script is even better . There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more " Hollywood " . James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor , I could not look away from him if I tried . I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well . I cannot believe this is his first real film . Brenda Fricker plays a small role , but as usual , she is outstanding . This is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are . If you like Awakenings and Mask , you will enjoy this story . You owe it to yourself to check this film out .
Before I saw this film I didn't really expect to much from it , although my friend advised otherwise . Due to this request from my friend I decided I was really going to watch this film . The minute I sat down to view the film I was absolutely blown away . From the credits I was falling of my seat ; I just couldn't contain myself . The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy . Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish Barber , who comes back from fighting in the war . Due to the heroics of the barber , he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board , which helps in the struggle which the jews had . But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested , but only then to escape to the confines of the Jewish surburb , ' The Ghetto ' . Due to this escape , the german army began searching which meant that the Barber and Stolz got arrested but again they escaped , only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion . * * * THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC , IT COMPLIES THE MORALS WHICH SOCIETY COULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT . IN THE SPEECH IT CONTRADICTS THE WHOLE MEANING OF THE FILM BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUNESS AND SINCERENITY WHICH IT ENTAILED , AND IT DEFINATELY WORKS , BECAUSE I DID WALK OUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES , LOOKING AT THE SMALLEST THING SUCH AS BEING IGNORANT TO SOMEONE TO THE BIGGEST , MOST PROMINENT THINGS SUCH AS WAR .
Well , I fell for it . I saw the box for this at the video store , and mistook it for " Girlfight " , which I'd heard was great . In my own defense , the titles are similar , and they re-did the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical . Anyway , to sum it up , they obviously re-did the whole cover packaging / promo to capitalize on the buzz / success of " Girlfight " . I popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight-to-video flicks , and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie , which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature . When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso showed up , I knew I'd fallen for it . ( don't get me wrong , she's a talented actress , but I knew she wasn't in " Girlfight " , the movie I'd been under the false impression I was renting ) . < br / > < br / > So , apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer , the movie was OK . The plot involves Belle , a young Latino woman who is the daughter of an ex-champion boxer . One of her close friends is a female boxer , who--and I could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a drag--gets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named " The Terminator " , who resembles a female version of a bigger , more pumped up Ike Turner . Of course , Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend . She lives with her caring , supportive yet protective Dad ( her mother died of cancer when she was younger ) , who just happens to be a cop . Her love interest , also caring and supportive yet protective , is also a cop who works with her dad . Hmmm , they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty ... wonder what's gonna happen ? She starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course , pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her . The actor they hired looks like a very low-rent Cary Eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache . His acting was also really , really bad . I'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen Rocky , or almost anyone , knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end . < br / > < br / > This was not a completely terrible movie . Most of the acting was OK , and the lead actress was very good . There were good , strong female Latino role models . The final fight scene did get me sort of interested , even though I knew everything that was going to happen long before it did . The actress that played " The Terminator " did a great job of being unlikeable enough that I really did want Belle to kick her a $ $ , and rooted for Belle-again , although there were absolutely no surprises . My favorite moment ( maybe the only moment where I wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake ) was when Belle slaps her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors , yells at him , and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear , showing that she is really the one in charge . < br / > < br / > The dialogue was really , really bad , my main complaint . One of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying " size doesn't matter " and the female replying wryly , " now where have I heard that before ? " Other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are " The doctors told me I may never walk again ! " " Come on , you know you can trust me ! " and " Your mother would have been so proud of you " . I could go on and on . Nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movies-of-the-week . < br / > < br / > Maybe I'm being too mean-the filmmakers did make an effort , and I did sit through the whole thing voluntarily ... but only because there was nothing else to watch while I worked out . You could do worse ( especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters ) but you could also do much , much better .
The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented . It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds . Errol Flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him . Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful . Arthur Kennedy never more villainous . Anthony Quinn never more noble than as Crazy Horse . It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout . The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final " Last Stand " which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn . The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight . However , I still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age .
The whole town of Blackstone is afraid , because they lynched Bret Dixon's brother - and he is coming back for revenge ! At least that's what they think . < br / > < br / > A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting , early Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western , obviously filmed in the Alps . < br / > < br / > Bret Dixon is coming back to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched . He is a loner and gunslinger par excellance , everybody is afraid of him - the Mexican bandits ( fighting the Gringos that took their land ! ) as well as the " decent " citizens that lynched Bret's brother . They lynched him , because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to Dallas to the safety of the bank there . But this is is only half the truth , as we find out in the course of this psychologically interesting western . < br / > < br / > But beware , it's kind of a depressing movie as everybody turns out to be guilty somehow and definitely everybody is bad to the bone ... < br / > < br / > Still , I enjoyed it very much and gave it an 8/ 10 . Strange , that only less than 5 people voted for this movie as of January 12th 2002 ...
I disagree 100 % with the reviewer who disagreed 100 % with the reviewer who gave this short movie an " F " grade . Cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his bag of tricks . The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales , save for this episode . < br / > < br / > Despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant , " Homecoming " is the least effective episode of MOH season one . Unlike the rest of the series , Dante's entry is a parody of the genre , falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham-fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point . < br / > < br / > Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf , as it wasn't his creation . The zombie sub-genre is very popular this decade , and among the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or ( ir ) religeous messages . Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans . Maybe Dante really isn't a a Master of Horror , either . What has he been up to since The Howling , after all ? < br / > < br / > If you want a lame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor , Homecoming may be just your thing . If you are a horror fan looking for something Masterful , pick up ... most any other episode of the series . My personal favorite was Dario Argento's " Jenifer , " based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson - - truly creepy .
I've read the positive comments on this movie . I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie , but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film . The jokes were mostly very bad , but when the jokes had some promise , the delivery was off . If you liked it , maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left . This movie had a poor script , bad acting , poor directing , weak plot ... nothing of virtue and was not entertaining . If you haven't seen this movie , don't .
Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher ( as Tom Stansfield ) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid ( as Lisa Taylor ) . Ms . Reid thinks Mr . Kutcher is gay . Kutcher works for Reid's father , an anal retentive Terence Stamp ( as Jack Taylor ) . Kutcher agrees to " housesit " for the boss , believing it will get him closer to Reid . Mr . Stamp has a pet owl named " O . J . " , who becomes a toilet cokehead . < br / > < br / > This is a film to get your restricted to " G-rated " pre-teens ready for raunchier " R-rated " fare . It will help if they haven't seen the plot before , and especially like moronic potty humor . Remember , people get paid to act like this . < br / > < br / > * * My Boss's Daughter ( 2003 ) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher , Tara Reid , Terence Stamp
Thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption I ever made ... < br / > < br / > Drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough ! < br / > < br / > Not only is the plot thin , but I get more emotional acting from my pet fish ! < br / > < br / > It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite , whom I respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with ... < br / > < br / > I think that a cardboard cut out of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job , and in fact have been more animate . < br / > < br / > Avoid at all costs ! This could really be hazardous to your health !
I get a kick out of the new Who fans who call it , excellent , Their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet , it's getting there . It's definitely good . < br / > < br / > First the good things . The special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of Doctor Who " Battlefield " was aired . < br / > < br / > One thing the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who ( except when they tried to cancel in the 70 ' s and 80 ' s ) . However , the anticipation and the pressure was great but I think the New series has passed the test it's good , it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws . Some of the stories " Dalek " were very poor . I assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the Dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series . < br / > < br / > " Aliens in London " was by far probably the best episode so far , it started a new storyline about Aliens which has lasted across several episodes including " Boomtown " . < br / > < br / > Now the other bad things , the companion , Rose , Billie Piper , isn't great . She's actually quite annoying but as is Dr . Who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part . < br / > < br / > Christopher Eccleston is pretty respectable , he's started to catch his niche . He tried to play the character , straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows . < br / > < br / > Continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well , Paul Mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back . < br / > < br / > Aside from that though the series overall is pretty good , I haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring , so I recommend any Doctor Who fan to check it out and see the new Doctor Who series .
I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time , read the biography , watched the specials , and saw the Karen Carpenter Story . This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter . In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner ( except for one girl friend ) . The real Karen Carpenter was much different . She was outgoing and friendly . She had lots of friends , especially Olive Newton-John . The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy " Karen " . Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York . When Karen was in New York , she did see a psychologist , but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room . Also , Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid , so she could loss weight , but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too . Also , the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight , but in real life was named Tom Burris . Also , Karen wasn't divorced from Tom , but only separated . Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died . Also , Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness , unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white . The music was very good . That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it .
The saving grace of this film is its humour . Playing up to the strengths of their star , Warner Brothers cast their version of General Custer as a cocky , dashing , irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism ; it was Robin Hood all over again , and Flynn blossomed in the role . All his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing , and this one was no exception . < br / > < br / > It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland , despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership ; the part of strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films , and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de Havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part . In this final collaboration , she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is , at heart , basically a romping adventure movie , and the screen chemistry is rekindled - - for once , she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple , to equally winning effect . < br / > < br / > The Flynn / de Havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability , when most of Flynn's other Westerns - - held in such affection by the contemporary American public , although allegedly not by their star - - have long since been forgotten . The action scenes are fairly cursory ( despite , ironically , the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges ) and the villains of the piece turn out , schoolboy-fashion , to be the same people who were horrid to Our Hero on his very first day at West Point , and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career . It cuts down on the cast list , but it's a trifle too morally convenient . < br / > < br / > However , these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment . Ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players ( memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader ) , Errol Flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal : charmingly sheepish looks , unexpected sweetness , mischievous twinkles , flash-point indignation , cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma . He's a reckless braggart , but you can't help but like him . And it's hard to go away without the tune of " Garryowen " threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter . < br / > < br / > This is one of Flynn's lasting hits ; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun , and is a film worthy of being remembered .
I was born in Beijing , China and moved to the United States at the age of 9 . Been home to Beijing several times since and loved it each time . One of the many things I love about Beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city . " You hau hao hao shuo " ( which translate more accurately to " if you have something to say , say it nicely " ) delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of Beijing . I suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie , though you might enjoy it regardless . < br / > < br / > > The story is not complicated , intentionally kinda quirky , and captivating . I will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments . Each detail , from the pictures on the wall , to the decorations , the streets , and restaurants feels like home . ( Zhang Yimou most likely shot everything " on location " ) But more importantly , the characters - our " hero " , the girl , the kind-hearted but unfortunate " laptop man " , and the night club owner are each native to Beijing and lovable in their distinct ways . Their conversations really capture the essence of each character . The story , mostly driven by situations and conversation ( save the brilliant bafoonery near the end ) is intriguing and always interesting . < br / > < br / > > I am 21 now . My parents and I love this movie . We are always so amazed by Zhang Yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters , and everyday life into extraordinary situations . < br / > < br / > " keep cool " - different . hilarious . meaningful .
Supreme Sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the U . S . government . She has to kill a known TV reporter , but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter . Because she hasn't killed him , she becomes the next target of her employers . < br / > < br / > The script isn't good although I've seen worse B-movies . A hit-man with remorse , the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror , ... What's next ? Aliens rescuing the victim ? ? ? No , Supreme Sanction will never win any award because of the script . And the acting isn't any better I'm afraid . A few better known actors ( Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson ) , who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie , together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either . < br / > < br / > So why should you watch this movie ? Well , if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10,531 st rerun of Mc Gyver or the A-team , than this might be the movie you want to see . Otherwise you better leave it alone . I give it a 3/10 .
Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage . The music is great , and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works . Samuel L . get's to shout a lot , which he's good at , as well as play lots of blues guitar , which he looks cool doing . Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend . I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s * % # , but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche , while still being an effective drama .
Let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie . It's unfortunate that IMDb doesn't have tenths of a star ... I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia , and it was absolute garbage . The plot was horrible . The acting was horrible . The movie was utterly boring . " malachi " looked like the Shadow with Alec Baldwin ( The Shadow is infinitely better than this as well ) The character Eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention . I didn't even know her name was Eve . Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut . The " TWIST " ( if you can call it that ) was laughable and pathetic . When it came , the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought " Who gives a S * * * . " The only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med . teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 ( Also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre . ) Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time . It's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career . In summary ... This movie is so bad , I feel dirty and need a shower . Worst movie in history , Gigli was better , Prom Night ( the remake ) was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better ...
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master , the bad guy , would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling . The writing is the best . < br / > < br / > I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger . If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it . This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood . I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons . I used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the Los Angeles Area . < br / > < br / > I remember the owl was always afraid , warning Max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one . Max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble . Norman was less talkative but his simplicity was funny . He would say things like " I eat monsters for breakfast " when he was battling them . And then when he was battling zombies he would say " I eat zombies for ... nevermind . " Classic cartoon comedy and action . < br / > < br / > I vote that they re-air Mighty Max .
Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror , science fiction and suspense films . There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films . Not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious ( " movie horror helps us deal with real horror " , " you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre " ) and pretty trite . Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring . And , shown out of context , these bits aren't very scary at all . And it's REAL short--I saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84 minute movie ! < br / > < br / > Still , it is reasonably well-edited and Allen and Pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves . For people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting . But if you're a horror fan ( like me ) you'll probably be bored silly . Good idea , bad execution ( no pun intended ) . I give it a 3 .
I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think . Not HA HA Wedding Crashers ' funny , but sick , twisted , I can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny . < br / > < br / > Jessica Bohl , who deservedly won Best Actress , is amazing to watch . There's never a moment when you think oh , I'm watching a movie and she's an actress . She's too damn real for words . < br / > < br / > In fact there's 2 scenes that I'm still giggling over , and I won't give them away , but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how " awesome " it is . ( I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing ! ! ! ) < br / > < br / > In another she talks about a teenagers definition of " sex " versus an adults , and if it isn't the truest dialog I've heard in a movie in a long time , I don't know what is .
Just saw this at the cinema . I haven't read the books . There is nothing new about this film at all . < br / > < br / > the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same ( ish ) ! There are several action scenes but they are very fake . filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close , move fast and turn the music up ... This leaves me feeling conned yet again . < br / > < br / > I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably . The characters are 2 dimensional . We hardly get to know them or feel for them at all . The lead has a charming farmers accent oo arrr ... though it seems he hasn't got much to say ... < br / > < br / > Don't bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters ...
Made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far . Lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time . What sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed .
At the end of my review of Cache , I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker . This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste , which I just finished watching about a half hour ago . < br / > < br / > It's all been expressed , here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would ' create ' an individual like Huppert's Erika , who is still trying , after years and years , to please her mother , at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life , beginning with her self . She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage , including , of course , her sexuality , which has literally imploded , to the point of madness , to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like . < br / > < br / > This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple , one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult . I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy , but there are needs , so many conflicting needs , most of which are not even on the conscious level . It also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about , sexually , and the reality of those fantasies , as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being . Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film , and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be . < br / > < br / > Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom : I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge ( for the viewer , I mean ) sucked out of it because of the prior scene , where she put the glass in the girl's pocket . By the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom , we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on , her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe . < br / > < br / > I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how , about halfway through it , I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading sub-titles . That has never happened before , in any foreign movie , and I've seen quite a few . < br / > < br / > In this film , like Cache , the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow , but unlike Cache , we do at least get some sense of finality , despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead . After experiencing La Pianiste , when it comes to Michael Haneke , I am , needless to say , more than a trifle intrigued .
This movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s , the animators were not lazy like they are today , the cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have today.If more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once again , therefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again .
Went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely loved the film ! ! ! I am Diane's # 1 biggest fan and of course , as always , she gave a magnificent performance ! ! I have seen every single one of her movies and I must say that this is one of my new favorites . Diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away . Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious . Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance . All in all , I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie . 10 thumbs up ! ! ! I would definitely go see it again and again and again . This is the best film of the year so far ! ! !
Continuing his comeback , John Travolta played a mildly twisted angel in " Michael " . He may be a messenger of God , but he's not the nicest guy , as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover . When I first saw this movie , it was before I had started watching " All in the Family " , so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker . Now that I recognize her like that , I try to imagine Archie snapping at her for harboring an angel ( whom he would probably rank alongside blacks , Jews , etc ) . < br / > < br / > I know , that doesn't really relate to the movie . But I just like to associate things that way . Anyway , it's a pretty interesting movie . Also starring Bob Hoskins , Teri Garr and Richard Schiff . < br / > < br / > What John and Paul said ...
Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film . I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him : he knows how to make entertaining movies . This is one more example . It didn't hurt , either , to have John Malkovich as his co-star . Now there is an intense actor ! In this story , Malkovich plays an assassin , and he is fascinating to watch , thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given . He also has a interesting voice . < br / > < br / > Rene Russo is fairly low-key ( for her ) , but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role , not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end . I guess he couldn't stop playing the " Dirty Harry " - type figures , but he played them well . < br / > < br / > There were some negatives this film , however , namely : credibility in parts as there were a couple of times , had this been real-life , the killer would have done away with Eastwood . The climatic scene , in particularly , had too many holes in it . There also were too many abuses of Lord's name in vain in here . < br / > < br / > Overall , however , this is good , escapist fare .
When this show began it was fairly interesting : we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season . Soon after , however , it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman . Episodes became nothing more than ' the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn ' ( this one happens way too often ) , ' someone is injured or sick ' , ' a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat ' , repeat . I don't know how people can find the newest seasons watchable , as every episode seems to be essentially the same as those before and after it . This show should be moved to a different channel and renamed to " Crab Boat Drama " , or , even better , it would have made a perfect one-time segment on Dirtiest Jobs . < br / > < br / > Shouldn't the Discovery Channel have learned their lesson after American Choppers ?
One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed , quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice . The final sequence , with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb . < br / > < br / > No , what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon ? It leaves you breathless , they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion . < br / > < br / > Tim Robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor , he's a nice director as well . < br / > < br / > * My rate : 9/10
An interesting premise , and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag ( side note : I'd love to see Drago , Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together ; talk about raging cheekbones ! ) . The soundtrack wasn't terrible , either . < br / > < br / > But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible , the directing worse ( perhaps contributory to the former ) , the dialog chimp-like , and the camera work , barely tolerable . Still , it was the SETS that got a big " 10 " on my " oy-vey " scale . I don't know where this was filmed , but were I to hazard a guess , it would be either an open-air museum , or one of those re-enactment villages , where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the " real Old West " . Okay , so it was shot on a college kid's budget . That said , I could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults . But taken all together , and being generous , I could not see giving it more than three stars .
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs , watermellons , people , etc . This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV . This is not because they want to , but because they have to . < br / > < br / > The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth , and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population . The movie is broken up in segments ; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I , and so on until the end of the movie , which is Phase IV . < br / > < br / > What is Phase IV ? Who knows ? We don't get to see that part ; presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area . The girl , who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler , is mad at the ants because they killed her horse , but except for one angry outburst , goes around the biodome with a blank ( " Clueless " ? ) look . < br / > < br / > These ants are pretty smart ; or the scientists are rather dumb . I'll give credit to the ants . Why ? Anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers , blow up trucks , and adapts to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species , at least in this movie . < br / > < br / > Sterno says stomp on this anthill . < br / > < br / >
Strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover-ups and lies . Very convincing documentary . A little bias but it hit hard on the government .

Going into Teaching Mrs Tingle , all I wanted was a fun , enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time . Despite a rather good first half hour , the film quickly subsides into a dull , clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers . Rusty pliers , at that . ' Scream ' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie , and proved that Scream may well have been a fluke . Most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films ; and while it was OK for him to steal elements from other movies in Scream , due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute ; here , it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas . The plot follows the cleverest girl in school , played by Katie Holmes . After being caught cheating along with two of her friends ; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home . However , this isn't just any teacher ; it's Mrs Tingle , the meanest bitch in school . She isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either , as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other . < br / > < br / > The plot is very similar to the 1997 flick ' Suicide Kings ' , and a whole host of earlier films . It's actually not a bad idea for a movie , and if Williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters ; it could have worked really well . The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the movie , but she's massively one dimensional , and like all the other characters in the film ; is merely a caricature . The acting is largely diabolical , with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role . She's suitably evil in the role , and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into ; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure . The teenage cast isn't worth mentioning , with only Katie Holmes standing out ; and that's only really because of her star profile , not her acting talents . Williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music , which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway . Honestly , this movie does have a few moments that are rather good ; but basically , if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this isn't the movie that you want to see .
6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching , so let me redress the balance . < br / > < br / > If this is the best that British Independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry . Unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes I'll never see again and hopefully I'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own . < br / > < br / > Whilst the idea behind the film is interesting , it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached . The student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won't care about what happens to them . The soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film , I kept waiting for Captain Markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache . Some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination , but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting , poor script writing and patchy camera work . The budget may have been better spent sending the " actors " ( and I use that term loosely ) to acting classes or the Thomas Brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt . The fact that the mis-spellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production . < br / > < br / > I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers , either that or they were watching a completely different film . I implore the Thomas Brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field , they will surely starve to death .
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film ? ? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure ! ! Did I see a painted water pistol in there ? Maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland ? Or maybe they just didn't have any money ? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds . Awesome ! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances . Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys . No Hollywood histrionics here . < br / > < br / > OK , so the effects work isn't very good . The spaceships just don't look as good as they should in todays FX world and I've seen much better free stuff on youtube . But the film holds together very well once they get to the Planet . Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew ? Or is it just better effects work ? Did they edit out the water ? By the end I kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died .
Since I'm from Norway ( one of the top ten ( or so ) richest countries in the world ) , it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times . And since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns , it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in Norway during the five minutes of the shooting there . Mr . Direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice , so he must have powerful friends in the customs . < br / > < br / > Please do at least _some_ research before going to an " exotic " country , dudes - - you may hurt the feelings of old fans . < br / > < br / > Sverre - - old fan with hurt feelings .
I'm grading this film on a curve , in other words , it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do . This is an excellent T & A film . I have no idea the count of how many T's or A's were seen in this film but I did see one shot that had 16 bare T's at one time , just to give you an idea . There are topless girls all throughout . There is a wet T-shirt contest scene . And the climax involves a game of touch football between two all-girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes . I don't know why this gets such a low rating here . Perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see Citizen Kane . I love this movie and hope to find more similar ones . If you are looking for a GOOD campy T & A film I'd recommend this one .
I was rather disappointed . The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins of the film . It was fresh , innovative , and just ... different . I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those " make you squirm " buttons . Tetsuo did just that where for me , few movies can . < br / > < br / > For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air , those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile , Testuo II will likely be a disspointment . If your looking for that visceral " HYPER-KINETIC " feel of the first movie , skip this one , as thats all been stripped away . Tetsuo II is for some odd reason , just a typical Hollywood style action flick . I was rather confused . However , it's still worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard Tsukamoto fan .
I haven't been a fan of Madonna for quite sometime now , however , I thought I would comment on this film . < br / > < br / > This film mistaken . One of them , as well as Madonna , was panned by the critics . They were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews . < br / > < br / > First , Madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first . She plays a ditsy blonde in the film , she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life . Most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake . When you view this film I hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting . She was absolutely hysterical as was the film . < br / > < br / > Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film . If you take a look at his filmography , you will see he is quite an accomplished actor . < br / > < br / > As far as the movie itself , this is something similar to pretty woman , but came 3 years before the Roberts , Gere success . It's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags , slapstick and one liners . Some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor . < br / > < br / > I know this doesn't tell you much about the movie , however , I hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie . It is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun . < br / > < br / > Peace . < br / > < br / > Gary
The Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser : Bloodline < br / > < br / > Starring : Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr . Paul Merchant , Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead < br / > < br / > Plot : This follows a timeline of the lineage of the Merchant bloodline , which started with Phillip L'Merchant , who created the box that opens the doorway to Hell . Starting with the 18th century to present time when Pinhead first meets Merchant and tries to sever the bloodline .. ( he's the only one who can stop Pinhead , you see ) and finally in the future , in space , where Paul Merchant has finally figured out how to send Pinhead to hell for good . < br / > < br / > Openers : This is a movie hated so much by the people who made it , they declared fictional director Alan Smithee would be the credited director . They only pull Smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie , such as classics as The Birds II : Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh . No I didn't make that up . How did I like it ? You're reading this so I'm sure that's what you want to know . < br / > < br / > The Good : This movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe . Oh I'm not going to sugar-coat it . This movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster , but it does have some positives . Cooler cenobites this time around for starters , such as the twins and the demon Angelique . Pinhead is still in a main role , and still has good lines ( " Pain has a face , allow me to show it to you " ) and it's somewhat entertaining throughout . Gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply . There is also some continuity with the rest of the series , although you'll have to look hard to see it . The Chatterer Dog is awesome . < br / > < br / > The Bad : But for a story about Hell vs the cursed Merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever , it was really complicated and held together with duct tape . Nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included . Pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom ! Random deaths just to feature more blood ( not always a bad thing , but not for the sake of the story ) . Pinhead is at his worst here , he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die ! For the very smart demon that he used to be , he's been reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain , at best . If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role , this is it . Bloodline ruined it for us all . < br / > < br / > The Ugly : Gore is always mentioned here . This one has skin ripping , drilling , hook impaling , beheadings , and more goodies . The Chatterer Dog , while awesome , reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes . < br / > < br / > Final Verdict : This movie had the potential for something great , even Hellbound levels of greatness . But all of that was wasted . Who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap , but we can only blame Alan Smithee . < br / > < br / > Compared to the rest : This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series . For completists only . < br / > < br / > Rating : 1/2 * of * * *
This movie is " the " stupid comedy of the year , and quite possibly the best thing from Mike Judge since " Office Space " . If you are a Mike Judge fan , or enjoy shows like Futurama , then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known , limited release . Although the DVD touts very few " bonus features " , this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived " lack of value " . < br / > < br / > This movie is about an army grunt by the name of Joe Bowers ( played by Luke Wilson ) who is part of a top secret Army experiment designed to preserve Army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country . However , things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten . Bowers , and his sidekick Rita ( played by Maya Rudolph ) both find themselves awake in the year 2505 , where through the course of natural selection , the population of America has grown increasingly stupid . Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of Frito ( played by Dax Shepard ) . < br / > < br / > What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedic satire on the course of US History over the last 50 years , and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years . This is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie , which has become a staple of the American culture . With shows like South Park in the mainstream media , it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future , profanity has become a marketing tool . This is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as " Fudd-Ruckers " changing their name to " Butt-F ###ers " , and a billboard which displays the advertisement " If you don't smoke Tarryltons ... F # # # You ! " . I also cannot stop laughing at Carls Jr . ' s role in this future , with their slogan " F # # # you ... I'm eating " , and their automated kiosks self-advertising their " Extra Big-A # # Tacos " . ( with more molecules ) ! This film contained everything I go to the movies for . Excellent , sharp , witty comedy , as well as an engrossing plot make this DVD one for the ages . Be warned , however . If you are not a fan of Mike Judge , did not care for " Beavis and Butthead " , or do not have a sense of humor , then this movie probably isn't a good match for you . Otherwise , I would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of 2506 ... I mean 2006 .
Enigma is a computer part which scrambles Russian messages , so that America can't understand them . They can only be read by the intended recipient . The Americans know that the Russians are going to transmit a message revealing the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out . < br / > < br / > So they send in former defector Holbeck ( Martin Sheen ) to grab the scrambler and substitute a false part , so they'll be able to decode the message , and block the assassination attempts . < br / > < br / > However , as we listen in on the Americans heads of the spy organisation , we find that they already have the scrambler , and they want Holbeck to try to steal Enigma , only to convince the Russians that they don't already have it . They don't expect Holbeck to succeed . That way the Russians , who had stopped transmitting with Enigma , just in case , will begin transmitting again . < br / > < br / > Enigma is in the computer in the office of Dimitri Vasilikov . Somehow Holbeck must gain access , and in order to do that , he must find out when Vasilikov will be out . He sends in his former girlfriend Karen ( Brigitte Fossey ) to seduce Vasilikov , so that she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements . Karen is glad to do it , as they tortured her father , a university professor , to death . < br / > < br / > Because we know that it's better for the Americans if Holbeck fails , the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller . We find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds , especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the Russians at every turn . < br / > < br / > But what's this ? Are Karen and Vasilikov falling in love ? Will Holbeck win Karen back , or will she actually end up with Vasilikov ? The romantic twist lifts this spy thriller , already worthy of a ten , even higher , for its originality . The writing , the direction , and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a compellingly realistic one . < br / > < br / > You find yourself at the edge of your seat , gripping your armchair , not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well . The two themes are interwoven perfectly , right up to the end . You really want both sides to win . So who does win , in the end ? You'll have to see the movie and find out , won't you !
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon . I've seen only 4 films so far , and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions . Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12 , and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings . < br / > < br / > This film is probably the only one ( out of four ) where this impact is for good . < br / > < br / > The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films , so it doesn't grab the accent ( although the looks of the characters might ) . Watch for the feelings , not for their objects . < br / > < br / > Very nice and fleeting , truly like a summer romance , and while being a relaxation to thought and mind , it gives some food for the soul .
Surface is one of the best shows that I have ever seen . NBC is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete . NBC or someone else should give Surface at least one more season just so it can be completed . It's as if NBC gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending . I just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to Nim . I think I can say this safely about most Surface fans is that we want to save Nim ! Nim has taken all of our hearts away and then NBC just cuts them in two . Come on NBC , just give Surface one more season !
i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels ; from production to plot and character development . < br / > < br / > this definitely fall under the " realism " genre , since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination , twists , or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel , think and asses . < br / > < br / > the actors are great , especially the " little " ones . the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing , maybe not even as common as should be in real life . it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it . one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end , but eventually everything does ...
I just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern accent some of the characters had , it took place in Wisconsin , not the south . As mentioned from other reviews , Ed Geine wasn't a big dude , so why did the guy that plays Jason and Leatherface portray him ? < br / > < br / > I fast forwarded through most of it being that there are many slow parts . < br / > < br / > Hopefully someone will do their homework on Ed Geine and the town and make a more accurate movie
I think a person would be well-advised to read or see ( I favour reading ) " Twelfth Night " before seeing , or re-seeing " She's The Man " . The movie is good on its ' own , but comparing the two , and looking for the in-jokes makes it a lot more fun . Shakespeare was inspired by others . I think he'd give a thumbs-up . < br / > < br / > Harld Bloom said in " Shakespeare , The Invention of the Human " , that most of the people in " Twelfth Night " need to be locked up . Malvolio , the person Malcolm is based on , is-for no good reason . People in " She's The Man " are sane in contrast . For instance , Duke Orsino is far more leval than the Duke of Orsino . He also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay . He displays a lot of self-control . < br / > < br / > It's a teen comedy ( a clean one ) , so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play . For instance Olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother . In the movie , she has been dumped . < br / > < br / > If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play , they don't have the same attention in the movie . < br / > < br / > The in-jokes are quite often quick . The hairdresser Pauls ' last name is given once . It is Antonio . Lots of people who've read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship . Deep love between men was noted in those days . Some see a sexual side to it-homosexuality was illegal . < br / > < br / > The only line from the play I caught is where Duke Orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar game . In the play , it is said by Malvolio , quoting Maria ) .
This movie almost has everything . The action is cool , it's funny , 2 great leading men and a truly nasty villain that I REALLY hated . Not a lot of films have BAD bad guys . Just mainly comic book villains . He really does deserve a might ass kicking . < br / > < br / > Jake Scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals . The direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel . I don't usually like films set in the old days but this I liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are ( Sense and Sensibility , Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady and the Duke ) . This will restore your faith . Thanx mostly to Craig Armstrong's amazing score . The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting . < br / > < br / > The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy looking 2.35 : 1 anamorphic picture .
I liked some of the characters , but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile . I didn't care two whits about him . He makes bad choices and I really didn't care since he did not seem to either . He seemed rather unintelligent . There were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight ( the scene with the whale was interesting ) , but these are lost in the general malaise of the film . The love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting , but the plot meanders around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film . In the end , I wondered why I stayed so long . < br / > < br / > There are some tepidly humorous moments , but ultimately I did not care . I cannot fathom rating the film higher . - 3 of 10
i remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when i was maybe 5 years old ( if that ) and to this day i can remember this movie ( in just bits and pieces ) . it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was sooo scared . I think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark . the main part that was the most freaky to me was Elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside . At the time I thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way hazy so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking ... and that part is what freaked me out the most . i really wish i could see this movie again . if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at valid908@yahoo.com
This film is terrible . Not only is the story unbelievable , the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly , to the point where it isn't shocking . I find it sad that Daisy Eagan , star of Broadway's The Secret Garden , decided that this would be a career step . The idea is interesting , two young girls coming of age very quickly . But the sex isn't even arousing . The film is silly , the story is silly , the performances are silly , and the whole concept while interesting falls flat . I'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet . Better Luck next time guys . My Scale * T-Scale *
* * * SPOILERS * * * This film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of Johnny Carson to determine who would succeed him . The impersonations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed in a satisfactory way by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck , though the performances weren't great . Reni Santoni is the best-performing of the " execs " ( he plays John Agoglia of NBC ) , and Warren Littlefield ( played by Bob Baliban ) is a close second . I was shocked at the way in which Littlefield eagerly discussed dumping Johnny Carson . This was Johnny Carson ! This scene evinces the cut-throat , what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television . Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the film as Jay's agent , Helen Kushnick . Another commenter asserted that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film . I respectfully disagree . The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence . She orders him around , and , when he rebels against her at the end , she tries to play the sympathy card ( mentioning her dead husband and son ); however , when Jay terminates their relationship , she turns violent again , screaming " Don't you leave me , you two-faced bastard ! " before smashing a picture on the floor . Overall , the movie is hilarious , and I wish that it were shown more often .
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple . The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors , each with a different goal . Some are Capra-cute , some screwball , some melodramatic , and some surprisingly noir . There's even an extended adventure sequence , when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard . It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous , when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone , and the storyline not exactly believable . Only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts , such as Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot , are also very well played .
My friend Zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store . I still feel ripped off , since I won't ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back . Having watched the first " Dark Harvest " the night prior to this viewing , I expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film . Wrong . < br / > < br / > There isn't a single scarecrow in the movie ( unless you count the one of the cover of the box ) , nor are there any real death scenes . The movie got its R rating from an 8 year old girl screaming " god d * * n " at her father . < br / > < br / > There is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable . Believe me , we tried .
Ah ! When good actors take on bland material ! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed . While the situations are very true to life , the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there . Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion . Much of the dialog is just plain silly . < br / > < br / > But ! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it , then you will LOVE this movie ! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one-note character of Detective Falon come alive with depth and pathos . Those of you who have never seen Elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film . And also , in his early fifties in this film , he looks fantastic ! His bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere ! Esai Morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as Det . Falon's eager beaver new police partner . He could have easily played it as a Robin to Elliott's Batman , but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role . He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say . < br / > < br / > Paul Sorvino is fun to watch ! He plays the eccentric police captain . He seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it . He makes it fun for us too . < br / > < br / > This movie is very by-the-numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances ! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do !
" An evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the Louvre museum " that's all I think , the summary of the movie and the movie itself ! Which I think it's one of the worst French or non French movies ever made in the history of cinema ! < br / > < br / > Nothing good in here except the music ( of the credits only ! ) , some tender moments of ( Sophie Marceau ) , and of course the movie's finale shot .. Not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching THAT CRAP but also for being so perfect as one magical C . G . I work that was too good to be true in here ! < br / > < br / > By the way I want to change the plot summary to be like this " An evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies " .. Just like this one for sure .
American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made . I've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time I see it . ( I graduated from high school in 1962 . ) < br / > < br / > However , More American Graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made . < br / > < br / > It is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel . The part of the movie set in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate . ( I served 18 months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division . ) < br / > < br / > The whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it . < br / > < br / > If anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies , More American Graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong .
( r #88 ) Brilliant , very entertaining show with spectacular effects . Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this . The CGI blends in extremely well with the environment and it's just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on Discovery Channel . This show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers " Walking with beasts " and " The future is wild " out of the water . < br / > < br / > The greatest episode was definitely the last , where we got to watch the final days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteor strike that became their doom . This stuff is almost too awesome for television . How about a theatrical release ? I would pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema . < br / > < br / > If you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular , engaging and educational at the same time , this is for you . Dinosaurs have never been cooler .
This is one of the best films I've seen from the silent era ( sad to say , I've yet to see too many with the exception of Chaplin / Keaton stuff ) . Very visually brilliant , with insanely influential style in editing and composition . Really unique ( especially for its time ) camera angles and extremely hectic editing . Definitely a must see for the film nerd . < br / > < br / > The downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics ( I have no problem with politics in film , as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a backseat to the story ) . Also , it's not an " entertainment " film , which is fine , but it's not something I'm going to watch a billion times . This is art , plain and simple , like it or not . < br / > < br / > Worth an A + for influence alone , but based on personal enjoyment , I give it an A - .
It's a shame this movie is rated PG 13 - - it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well . < br / > < br / > It belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost / angel stories that would have to include everything from Capra's " It's A Wonderful Life " to Wenders's " Wings of Desire . " < br / > < br / > The photography is stunning , the acting first rate , and--wonder of wonders--the tone is uplifting . < br / > < br / > My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film . The two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first ; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste . As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD , all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on his bedside table . The symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me . < br / > < br / > But what a lark ! My favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner . This is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle , playful , and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque . < br / > < br / > " Northfork " is funny , touching , gorgeous to look at , magical ( with the above reservations ) and has not one single car-chase . < br / > < br / > An easy nine stars .
I've watched hundreds of kung fu movies and I've heard some good thing about this movie , so I decided to give it a try . What I saw was one of the worst displays of movie making I've ever seen . < br / > < br / > I can't help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in Hong Kong in this movie . Everyone overacts to the point of stupidity . Even Conan the Barbarian had some civility . This movie just has half-evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self-respect . The narrator's character should've be killed for sucking so much ... she really didn't deserve to live til the end . The entire movie was a melodramatic mess , with horrible acting , bad directing and bad action . They should've just rename this movie to ' The Stupid One-Armed Caveman with a Blade " Here's a question ... why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies ? Answer : To can hide the deficiencies of the actors . Nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow . The movie tried so hard to show intensity , but it became almost laughable . Please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung-fu movies ... or any taste in movies .
One only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD , but , alas , alas ! How so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature's richest tales into such a monumental BORE , is totally beyond me . It's pretty to look at with lovely photography , particularly the Yarmouth sequences , but , JUST PLAIN DULL ! ! ! No need to go on ! Skip it and check out the Selznick or the marvelous BBC mini-series from the 1980 ' s .
On the positive , I'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable . On the negative , it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen . Long , whiny and pointless . And I'm not saying this to be mean , I really wanted to like this film , it seemed to have everything going for it , had the so called " buzz " , and was a hassle to track down besides . Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side , I believe this would've been amazing . And I expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future , they clearly have the ability . But I recommend waiting for their future efforts , let this one go .
I saw this at a drive-in when I was 9 . All I remember are a few scenes ( the ones where the main character Elle is being chased by a guy in a mask ) and being scared spitless . Seeing it now , my opinions have changed . It's a pathetic " horror " film about an ophanage run by Gloria Grahame ( sad ) and dealing with a young , talentless girl Elle who is sent there after her mother , the town tramp , was beaten to death with a hammer ( graphically shown ) . The film has adolescents ( actually actors in their 20s ) being beaten , tortured , killed , starved , attacked with meat cleavers , raped etc etc . The brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse . There is NOTHING to recommend about this crap . The plot is stupid , all the dialogue is bad and the acting ... the less said the better . How did this sickie get by with a GP ( now PG ) rating ? It would get an R now . Worthless . One last thing ... a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest !
Trilogies are very interesting . Some go out with a bang ( Lord of the Rings ) , some get progressively weaker ( The Matrix ) , some get lost in obscurity ( Blade , Back to the Future ) , but some maintain the genius , that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior . Case and point : " Three Colors Trilogy " . This chapter in the trilogy , being the last one , is the most philosophical and thought-provoking . In " Blue " we had a more visually stunning , more character-driven plot , in " White " it was more of a light hearted , narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything . " Red " , however is focused on the " what ifs " and " how comes " . It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present . < br / > < br / > This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner . She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors ' phone calls through advanced spying equipment . All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines , but bring a lot more to the story . Consider in " Blue " , the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones . We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character's behavior . " Red " is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life , but it is also about chance , hope , and fate . < br / > < br / > Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut , who at first finds the old man ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ) , whom we never find the name of , extremely self-centered and disgusting . Though through self reflective analysis , and her voyeuristic intentions , she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her , if only he was 40 years younger . Irene lives across from another , younger judge , who highly resembles the old man . This is the " what if " that keeps circling in the movie . What if Irene were born 40 years ago ? The old man would have been her perfect match . But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match , since he so closely resembles the older one . Valentine doesn't know this , only we do , and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in . We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence , as almost a suggestion of Irene's fate . < br / > < br / > I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason . That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story . We are to compare the old judge to Auguste ( Jean-Pierre Lorit ) , the younger judge , in more than one way . We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away . In another scene , we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man . There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man . Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day . There is also the motif of the telephone , to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life , to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak , and to the old man , it is the only thing he has left . These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology . It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are . < br / > < br / > All three " Colors " films stand for a certain principle , most common in France . " Blue " stands for Liberty ( the personal being ) , " White " stands for Equality ( being accepted by more than one ) , and " Red " is Fraternity ( to socialize , to learn ) . And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle , Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well , in order to connect all three stories . For example , we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment , which is a reflection of the Equality principle . We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others ( not picking up the phone when Michel calls ) , a clear example of Liberty . And with all three principles established , Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well , in the final and most heartfelt scene . < br / > < br / > " Red " is about where you could have been if you were older or younger . It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone , and whether or not one person can change your life . The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made , this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling . It is not only about our modern life , but about where life could and should be in our modern time . And although the movie is more subtle than both " Blue " and " White " , it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion . < br / > < br / > It's hard to imagine that " Red " was Kieslowski's last film , and that he died at such a young age . Nevertheless , the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman , Fellini , and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar . Kieslowski , you have been missed !
If you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the " villain " not be more sympathetic than the " victim " . And this fails miserably . It was so terrible and frustrating to watch that I was actually moved to register and comment . OK , so the husband is rich and cocky . There are worse vices , and the cabana boy and wife display plenty . The husband is a jerk because he - um , didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot BTW . The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife . He then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him . Uh huh . The misogynistic , inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting . It is one thing when a fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims . What was he thinking ? ? ?
If like me , you enjoyed the first film " Bruce Almighty " , my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high ; in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film-sense at all . < br / > < br / > Without giving too much away , the story sees Evan ( Bruce's nemesis co-anchor from the first film ) move home with his family to the Virginian suburbs to " Change the World " with a new political path . What follows is a rather far-fetched and quite ' silly ' storyline , which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience . Unlike it's predecessor , Evan Almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of ' comedy ' tagged upon it's misleading position of ' sequel ' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature , upscale audience . < br / > < br / > Generally speaking , Evan Almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values . The acting ; omit Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman , was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production . Additionally , the cast includes acting legend John Goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety ; I didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy . Every other character in the movie ( especially the wife and kids ! ) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size Kiev . Be warned though ; it is the typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated films , so I'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight . < br / > < br / > It may seem the movie is worthless thus-far , however , it does have - some - promising aspects . The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the Ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end . The particles , renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar . Although part of me couldn't help , but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were , in my opinion , ' too good ' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout . < br / > < br / > Overall I view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential , but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content I had so far witnessed . This wasn't the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits . As I sat discontent I couldn't help , but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as ' Mighty ' as I hoped for . In many ways the film reminded me of a watered down " Night at the Museum " as it showed similar styling and characteristics , but unfortunately was leagues below even that . < br / > < br / > I give this movie 3 out of 10 , as it is watchable , but it's definitely one to be avoided ! If you HAVE to see this film , be prepared for disappointment as ' mildly entertained ' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production .
The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it was supposed to be " Horror " . Don't be fooled , this movie has to be the worst " horror " film I have seen . It's about these people who go to a secret location which has a " Monster " in it . The monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains . Some people die , some people don't . In the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily . BUT OH NO ! THE MONSTER IS STILL ALIVE AFTER FALLING OUT OF A PLANE ! Go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall , trust me , it's more entertaining than this crap .
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work , distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition , inserts hateful ideology , incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place , and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle , Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers . Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it . < br / > < br / > Stocking Hell with Republican political figures , Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege , to say nothing of extreme liberal bias . It is , however , unoriginal , tedious and trite . Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining , humorous or enlightening , despite his smug pretension to the contrary . < br / > < br / > I could have eaten a reel of video tape and PUKED a better movie . I regret the two hours of my life that I lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry . Calliope will weep forever .
this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far . i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes ... ' 9 souls ' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School . they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways . the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated . it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey . the second half , moved me to tears . as the movie progresses , each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams , but unfortunately ending somewhat badly . in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left . the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes . a beautiful film directed fantastically . this is a movie for people who have enjoyed Toshiaki Toyoda's other films such as ' Blue Spring ' .
This is definitely a " lesser known " comedy short from the 1920s . The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie . They are interesting and historically important , but also generally average to below average for the style film . Compared to shorts by Chaplin , Keaton , Arbuckle and Lloyd , they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor . Also , the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs . I ended up turning OFF the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood . But , despite this , they are still worth seeing . < br / > < br / > I've gotta be honest about this short . It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it , I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts . So , it is possible the film might be A LITTLE better than a 4 - - but certainly , if this is the case , no better than a 5 ! The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy . Nothing especially interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there .
This movie is so bad there are not words to describe it . If I got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this . The plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning . The best part of the movie was when the credits roled and I got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was James Bond III . Just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap !
This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie . The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies : The Penguin ( wonderfully played by Danny DeVito ) Catwoman ( the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer ) and Max Shreck ( the superb Christopher Walken ) . < br / > < br / > Perhaps the best entry in the series , it has it all : complex themes , complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out . The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin . Here is a guy who is evil , pitiable , funny and perhaps most importantly , scary . The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine . In other words , the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances . < br / > < br / > I do not hesitate to say that " Batman Returns " is my favorite of all the Batmans released ( sorry , Dark Knight fans ) . If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action , then please check out this badly underrated film . < br / > < br / > If nothing else , it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made .
I personally LOVE this film amidst the Halloween series . I've found , after watching it with many friends , that you enjoy it completely , or find it absolutely unbearable . Personally , i've watched it dozens of times , and it never gets old . There is a great back story within the movie itself , and a lot of different things are finally explained . It's a rather short movie , at just shy of 90 - minutes , but it's definitely a thrill ride . < br / > < br / > The shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film , but the acting is still there with the way he walks , stalks and kills . There are a lot of neat little screen shots with Micheal appearing in the background , which adds more of a spooky element to the movie .
Growing up as of child of the movies , one of the trilogies I shall not soon forget is that of the Karate Kid . You can put down Ralph / Daniel all you want , but its the message behind the movies that are important , that its important to be respectful to all creatures great and small , but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it . Getting back to the movie at hand , its rather funny because , I saw Boys Don't Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank , and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night , I came across the showing of this film and I hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it . The story centers around Julie , just like Daniel , not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her . I really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes , even some outfits that Hillary were in kept me , shall we say stimulated . < br / > < br / > Overall 3.5 out of 5
John Huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement , and it's thoroughly his testament : uncompromising , difficult , a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions , it will stand as the best " last film " you can ever dream of . A very austere screenplay , no action , no real hero , but a group of people coping with the vanity of life , the fleeting years and death.The party doesn't delude people for long.Admittedly , warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal , complete with turkey and pudding.But the passage of time has partly ruined Julia's voice , first crack in the mirror.Then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the old lady's bedroom.For sure , hers seems to have been a happy life , but it's a life inexorably coming to an end-A shot shows towards the end of the movie Julia on her future deathbed - . Maybe an unfulfilled life , because she remained a spinster , with no children to carry on . Only some poor things , yellowish photographs , bibelots and trinklets ... But are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled ? Look at Gretta.She ' s a married woman , about thirty-five , she's still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken.What Julia is today , she will be tomorrow , that's why , in her stream of consciousness , she goes back to her past , only to find out how harrowing her memories are : a young man committed suicide for her , a symbol of her youth now waning.The final monologue , if we listen closely to it , involves us all in this eternal tragedy , the doomed to failure human condition , John Huston's masterly lesson .
The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction . The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain . But I think of the three this one is the best . < br / > < br / > Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet . Who knows , maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location . It's the only flaw I find in the film . < br / > < br / > Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss Robert Strauss when the game was raided . He took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer . But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him . < br / > < br / > First Bob Strauss who wants him back dealing , especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town . He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back . Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and hooked as a customer again . And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all , just to keep him around . < br / > < br / > Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film , but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty . Sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that Marty was such an acclaimed film in that year . His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken . < br / > < br / > Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role . She's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost . If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody , she might have been nominated for this . 1955 marked the high point of her career . < br / > < br / > Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler . His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl . < br / > < br / > Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the characters live in . Not a place you'd want to bring up your family .
I read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received , and viewing the trailer , I decided to check it out for myself . What a disappointment ! It starts out well enough . the opening scene was actually pretty tense , but from there it's all downhill . I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie , but by doing so , they took all the enjoyment out of watching it . Those choices combined with the " C . S . I " editing , use of music and montage , lack of suspense , scares , or humor really drag this film down . There's too much foreshadowing and to many " subtle " clues , so when the first twist arrives early on , you already know how the movie is going to end . I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job , other than that I can't recommend this movie .
There is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane , everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for Airport 77 . You can even make out Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots . A total rip off ? Well almost by definition . There may be more stock footage in this film than in Plan 9 From Outer Space . < br / > < br / > All the new material , actors sitting around in an airplane set talking , is bland and terrible on every level . Dennis Weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie , though that's true for everyone other than this films director Fred Olen Ray , who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working . < br / > < br / > There is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time , it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all , because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school TV fashion that this film , like most of his films , is totally devoid of life . The worst kind of hack work . The worst kind of film . Boring . < br / > < br / > This type of film is a waste of money , an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared / participated in this rip off . There are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see Ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time . < br / > < br / > His commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really Fred Ray as he isn't credited on the film itself . That tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you .
This was such a beautiful film . Such an amazing performance from Joseph and Brad . Very innocently written and performed . A must see ! ! I cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie . This is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch , it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of AIDS , how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them . Not only with AIDS , but with any terminal illness . I hadn't even heard of this movie until I scrolled through t . v . one day and happen to run across it . I recommend everyone to watch this , just don't forget your box of tissues . More movies should be made like this one . Extremely heartwarming .
What can I say ? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be . The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before , was strictly for IAN McSHANE . < br / > < br / > I was not disappointed in the least . IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role . He's always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor . < br / > < br / > As for the rest of the film ... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong , solid performances . These people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation ( as this was a fairly low budget film ) but this did not mean that any of them " mailed " their appearances in . Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them . < br / > < br / > I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL's performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie . < br / > < br / > The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life , not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film . Anybody who expected a clear-cut , by-the-numbers , connect the dots " conclusion " or " answer " at the end of the movie ... CLEARLY wasn't watching the film closely enough ! This film is not going to tell you what the " meaning of life " is ! The idea is that after seeing the film , you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee . I certainly did . < br / > < br / > No car chases ... No explosions ... No bar room brawls ... ( sounds pretty dull , huh ? ) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved . < br / > < br / > * * * WARNING ... * * * If you're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous " question " as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly ... < br / > < br / > YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM .
Finding the premise intriguing , and reading the reviews , and being an Angel fan , I watched this movie . It's sexy and original , and quite entertaining . David Boreanaz is Keith . He's a hunky married man , stay at home Dad , and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage . He makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man . They'll do anything to get into his bed , including beg , lie , and blackmail , but they mostly try to push his buttons . The nuttiness that ensues sends Keith reeling , and pushes friendships to the edge . David Boreanaz shows a little skin in this one - - and he's looking hot . Yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end . One more thing , when someone moans " oh yeah , oh .. oh .. YEAH ! ! " , it's hard to see them as a victim of rape .
Heh ... I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form , let alone it being available for rent ! < br / > < br / > This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T & A and the cheap laughs . The story line crosses a bit of " Texas Chainsaw massacre " with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of " Psycho " , and a bit of the good old women-in-chains , tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words , complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy ! Looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of Quebec pass off as Southern U . S . bayou land is sad , I tell ya ! < br / > < br / > Funny thing for me is , I was actually at the premier of this flick as , at the time , I was pals with Ratchford , the film's " star " . It was painful to watch on as Jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings . < br / > < br / > I'm happy to see that Ratchford , after this sham of a first flick , has grown into one hell of an actor . He can be seen regularly on the Canadian cop drama " Blue Murder " , has appeared on " CSI " , not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood film " Unforgiven " - we forgive ya , Jeremy ! It was a rocky start , but you done good , man ! < br / > < br / > ~ T.Paul
I have read all of Jane Austen's novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present . < br / > < br / > I loved this movie for its romance and for the music , which stayed , hauntingly , in my head . It was an interpretation of course , not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility , but something quite different and something Catherine herself would have loved . And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry ! This was the Henry of Catherine's imagination , and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels , and which was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one . I wonder if Jane was being entirely satirical in her novel . Perhaps , she too , could imagine such a Henry . < br / > < br / > I haven't seen the film in many years , at least a decade . But , I have been yearning for it ever since .
Licence fees to watch this trash , And pay for it with hard-earned cash ? Humourless , no hint of laughter , God knows how it won a BAFTA ! < br / > < br / > We've now been subjected to " Eastenders " for twenty years . When , oh when is the Great British public going to see this awful soap for what it is ? Crass Pap ! This programme no more depicts reality in the East End of London than everyday life in Beirut , and never has done . < br / > < br / > The Eastenders I know ( the real ones ) are kind , courageous , hardworking and loyal . And one of their greatest attributes is humour . It was the Eastenders who went through the worst of the London blitz and still stuck two fingers up to Hitler . And what do we see on our screens for five days of the week ( including an omnibus ) ? Nothing but a bunch of moaning , wailing , " dead from the neck up " wimps , who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other . What a great advert for Britain that is ! ! Do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out ? Obviously the woolly-minded section of the public does , but then I've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything .
This is not a film to impress you with high budget , high-tech shots , fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director . But it's a film by a director who is also a very good photographer , who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human , not as an half-god unlike most of the directors . This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best ' performances ' with unreal or , at best , learned gestures and mimics . Rather , it's a film in which they act as real as it can be . Actually , they are not professional actors at all . The dialogues between the main characters , their expressions , their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life . You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words . You show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest . This is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life . And this is your chance to see yourself from outside , impersonated by the main characters . I saw all of the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan , incl . his short film Koza ( Cacoon ) thanks to those who puts it in the DVD . Many would compare him with Tarkovsky , Ozu and maybe Bresson or Bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur . And he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life . That is the kind of sincerity you'll find in Uzak .
" Son you must stop the experiments I have started ! ! " Too bad nobody said this too whoever green lighted this project ! ! I was almost literally dragged to this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high-school . Now , a midnight movie in high-school on a Friday night , you are not expecting much , but c'mon ! ! And upon seeing it again years later I sill stand by my original opinion of it . Great special effects but so what ! ! Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made . Unless you enjoy blood and guts and seeing some Hollywood vets ( Steiger & Hunter ) make fools of themselves for a buck . YUCK ! ! !
The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it . I have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time . I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo , Cheech n chong , Monty Python series and many others but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies . Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal , Munnabhai series and Herapheri series . SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving . But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above . Its what i call the Hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie .
Well , " built " Doris Day ( as Ethel S . " Dynamite " Jackson ) is mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore , and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger ( as S . " Sam " Winthrop Putnam ) . Older Frenchman Claude Dauphin ( as Philippe Fouquet ) also digs Doris . Honestly What were they thinking ? - This wildly inappropriate musical does feature Ms . Day prettily singing the standard " April in Paris " , and others . Certainly , there nothing as good as her Columbia recordings from the time ; and , nothing approaches Day's stunning and forthcoming " Secret Love " . Although the material does not serve him well , it's nice to see Mr . Bolger performing . Some of the musical numbers are obnoxious . < br / > < br / > * * * April in Paris ( 12/24 / 52 ) David Butler ~ Doris Day , Ray Bolger , Claude Dauphin
This late-ish effort from Freda plays as a modern day ( 70 ' s that is ) Gothic thriller , but comes out short of thrills . Certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film , it's jut got that feeling which many of Freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first daily's . It starts out good enough , almost giallo like in tone , then takes a turn into Gothic territories with a decent ( albeit terribly cliché ) set up . Then suddenly Freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles . Then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent-to-poor special effects . This is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending ( If it's even intended to be a twist ? ) . And throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got Tragic Ceremony . Thus in parts it's got its qualities . But then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you . A pity . < br / > < br / > btw stay away from the SHAROMA DVD , a useless murky pan & scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience .
I saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it . My Uncle Antoine is much , much greater than the sum of it's parts . The movie , loosely , is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada . There are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building . MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience , the reward is coming . I believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-English speaking movies I've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version . Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors , with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit . The English speaking Amarcord is a travesty , for example , while the sub-titled version sings . My Uncle Antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in French .
This show is up there with the best Comedys made in Australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want . Some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life . What is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people ( the chasers ) who love doing what they do and who would n't . This show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which I've already mentioned , Mr ten Questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the Beach boys , temporary ones like The Chasers Emmys and ones that have been there from the start like What have we learnt from Current affairs this week . Overall I rate thin show 98 % .
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 ' s ; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians , an officer determined to see that task through , and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit . This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive . The Indians know , all to well , that the small band is undermanned , and could be wiped out before the help comes . One major difference for this film , " Only the Valiant " , is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline , but at the same time , deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all , even if they don't accept that charge . < br / > < br / > Gregory Peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the Indians from breaking out into the territory . The troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort ; they , in turn , have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause . Eventually , the captain and the small band confront the hostiles , and at the same time , each confronts his own flaw . The cast includes western stalwarts such as Ward Bond , Gig Young , Neville Brand , Lon Chaney , Jr . , and Warner Anderson . < br / > < br / > A sleeper of a film , and a good solid western for fans of this genre .
This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station at 1.00 am a couple of nights ago . This might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film , strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience . Come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children . It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful show across the world . In this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen . I'm not advocating child abuse but to see Howard Spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better . Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone all PC ? I mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell ? < br / > < br / > Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie . As someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden . I guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he's famous for but it fails to work here and there's many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting . But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
In case you dear readers never heard , this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L . Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man . This 80s - drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short ' n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town cops who don't play by the rules . That's pretty much the extent of the movie . Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines ' line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and " NYPD Blue's " Jimmy Smits . My favorite scene is , I dunno , the car chase on the tracks , I guess . Basically , I just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks . Well , this and Lethal Weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and The Man ...
Let's begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films : good , bad , and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way . Dark Harvest promises big with its Artisan DVD cover , but rest assured that is where the show stops . Following a grueling opening montage , we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script , extremely under qualified ( even for a beginners film ) acting , disastrous lighting and even worse special effects . Seriously , could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain , or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers , so it's good enough for us ? Well , it did not work at all to create a scary villain . At any rate , this is one of the movies that make you check your watch , sigh and curse your own gullibility . The timing in every scene is painful , and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it ( come to think of it , I have seen better middle school stage productions , right down to the special effects ) . I'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note , so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters , Frisbees , wind chimes ... I'd say " go see your yourself " , but that would just be cruel . < br / > < br / > Check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies . They claim to honor the contract between film and audience ( i . e . please the fans ) but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash ( of which I am sure they saw very little for this ) . < br / > < br / > Sorry people , the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty . < br / > < br / > 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating . Giving it even one makes me angry .
This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long . There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white . The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged . Even the dialogue was good along with the acting . It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order . I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying " everyone has a box " which he put his personal things into . Also , on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight , two other great movies . There is a great twist in the end which I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it , even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card . I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books . This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it , plus it only being an hour long . There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which I thought was pretty brilliant .
That snarl ... < br / > < br / > That scowl ... < br / > < br / > The acts of random violence ... < br / > < br / > The gutteral voice ... < br / > < br / > The fetish wear ... < br / > < br / > That shaven head ... < br / > < br / > It can mean only one thing ... < br / > < br / > GRACE JONES IS BACK ! < br / > < br / > Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva , but by Wesley Snipes . < br / > < br / > All in all this is not an improvement . < br / > < br / > Blade is an adaptation of a comic character ; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic , two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions . < br / > < br / > The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre , in fact , much like Nosferatu , it seems to suck the life out of the audience . In brief , upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade , half-human , half-vampire , all annoying . It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press , some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968 . < br / > < br / > Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher ( also a comic adaptation , perhaps there is a trend here ? ) . Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the ' hero ' ? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character , this is not true of Blade , he is relentlessly cruel , scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys . < br / > < br / > I assume that Wesley Snipes has an ' acting ' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably . As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave . < br / > < br / > As a piece of narcissism , Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever . Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance ; the likes of Steven Dorff * CAN * act , but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes ' tedious performance . < br / > < br / > Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies , here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel . And what happens when Blade finds out ? Yes , you guessed it , he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair . < br / > < br / > Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house ? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose . A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements . < br / > < br / > The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre . Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again . < br / > < br / > To finish , there * IS * a Grace Jones vampire movie , it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this .
Goldie Hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man , a dentist , played with such relish by Walter Matthau , that she won the best supporting actress Oscar for 1969 . < br / > < br / > The film , however , is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman . Rarely , did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for Matthau to tell Hawn that they're married . < br / > < br / > It is such a joy to watch Matthau and Bergman fall for each other here . Theirs is an accidental love affair in the making . < br / > < br / > As Matthau's friend , Jack Weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well . Rick Lenz gives ample support as Hawn's newly-found boyfriend as well .
First , what is really great about this movie : < br / > < br / > - Ryan Reynolds , great acting ! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them . He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters . < br / > < br / > - The soundtrack ! Very good music played at the right time . < br / > < br / > - The idea of a nine lost in his own world , incapable of leaving . < br / > < br / > Still , I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws : < br / > < br / > - Horrible second part . It seems that the director was very eager to make something new , but despite of the efforts it was really boring < br / > < br / > - Very annoying character Melissa . I couldn't stand the scenes with her - i . e . it was constantly annoying . She represents everything that is wrong with American woman . < br / > < br / > - Terrible explanation of the numbers . The director was so busy with character development , that he completely missed the point of a good story .. excuse me koalas ? brr ... terrible ! < br / > < br / > This movie had great potential . The filming is nicely done , the music is really good , but nothing more . < br / > < br / > See it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds , or have a lot of time to spare .
This wonderfully witty comedy-drama wowed the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival , whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion . Buttressed by adept performances by a nuanced cast , sturdy execution by director Jeff Hare , a brisk pace , and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years , the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life . < br / > < br / > Falk excels as Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum , a wildly eccentric Shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life , but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a " big fat Jewish suicide party . " The film brims with indelible delights . There's Morris's " tushy room " ; Laura San Giacomo's passionate rendering of Morris's cynical daughter ; rapid-fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen ; the wry timing of David Paymer , who plays Morris's tightly wound psychotherapist son ; and Morris's patented egg creams ( but be careful , drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze ) . It's all enveloped in a feel-good , intimate atmosphere set in New York City . < br / > < br / > Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman , drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a mirthful humanity . I was fortunate to see an earlier film by Hare : the dark and powerful " Perfect Little Man , " starring Neal McDonough ( " Minority Report " ) as a Los Angeles man spiraling into madness . The visceral grit of " Perfect " and the nostalgic breeze of " Checking Out " are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent . I'm looking forward to checking out his future work . < br / > < br / > I heard " Checking Out " lacks a distributor at this point . Some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem , for it's a potential box-office titan in the vein of " My Big Fat Greek Wedding . " Most nobly , it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie .
I like to like movies , but I found nothing to like about The Box . I was interested in the ' hook ' of the plot , but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow . Anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something , well I have news for them , the emperor has no clothes . < br / > < br / > The only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin , and corrupting mankind . I've heard that story before , and it makes less and less sense every time . It's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres , but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price .
I saw this film on September 1st , 2005 in Indianapolis . I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award . A Truly Moving Picture " ... explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life . " Heartland gave that award to this film . < br / > < br / > This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century . At that time , it was the game of upper class and rich " gentlemen " , and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs . With this backdrop , this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young , working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world , Harry Vardon . < br / > < br / > And the story is inspirational . Against all odds , Francis Ouimet ( played by Shia LaBeouf of " Holes " ) gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U . S . and Great Britain at the 1913 U . S . Open . Francis is ill-prepared , and has a child for a caddy . ( The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in . ) But despite these handicaps , Francis displays courage , spirit , heroism , and humility at this world class event . < br / > < br / > And , we learn a lot about the early years of golf ; for example , the use of small wooden clubs , the layout of the short holes , the manual scoreboard , the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths , the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways , and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain . < br / > < br / > This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing . And with no big movie stars , the story is somehow more believable . < br / > < br / > This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of " Miracle " and " Remember the Titans . " < br / > < br / > FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years .
Yeah sure , the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good , so I still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie . This however unfortunately wasn't the case . The premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawed . < br / > < br / > This movie is potential flushed down the toilet . The main plot is interesting and somewhat original . It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think . This movie however fails to entertain and I think that that is this movie biggest flaw . Perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm . Instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie , filled with the one unlikely event after the other , that also steals a bit too much from other , more successful movies . Mainely " Jurassic Park " obviously . < br / > < br / > The characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch . I still think that Edward Burns did a fairly decent job as the ' heroic ' main lead . The rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do . The movie rather relies on its visual , which are extremely poor . Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character . Basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong . Her character just isn't a likable one . And the rest of the characters ... well I already have forgotten their names , I think that that is saying enough about them . It certainly is true though that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth watching . He is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly . < br / > < br / > Visually the movie is extremely poor . It has some dreadful looking CGI effects and they couldn't even get the more simple ' blue-screen ' effects look convincing in the movie . The sets are also awful and cheap looking , like they can fall over and break down every moment . < br / > < br / > The movie never gets tense , exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible . It's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress . There are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough . < br / > < br / > So basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one . It's sad to see how low director Peter Hyams has sunk to the last couple of years , after making some good movies in the ' 70 ' s and ' 80 ' s . < br / > < br / > 4/10
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over . The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream . She honored her father , boyfriend-husband , and her lover . The character had many shades . Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor . Some stories do have happy endings . Aside from the love story angle I thought about how a beautiful , serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people ... government makes the decision whereas the people suffer . Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams . I loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake . They were survivors .
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film , but with Today You Die , I feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time . < br / > < br / > So here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is . < br / > < br / > There was a time in the mid - 80s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs ; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet . If he actually got a hold of you , he would snap you like a twig . < br / > < br / > These days , although he is still capable of doing considerable damage , he no longer looks the part . He's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it quits . He walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated , and he has put on weight . His trademark long ponytail has gone , but his hair still looks stupid . How this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me . < br / > < br / > Today you Die is the usual Seagal mix of bone crunching fights , car crashes , gun battles and pyrotechnics . Seagal mumbles his way through the dull script , delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability . In this third-rate action flick , he plays Harlan Banks a thief trying to go straight , who is conned into partaking in a $ 20,000 , 000 robbery . He gets caught , goes to jail , escapes , and seeks revenge . Yawn . < br / > < br / > There are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff ( of which there is a lot ) , but reading other comments on IMDb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies . Seagal is also body-doubled an awful lot in this one . < br / > < br / > Seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his career  and that's saying something , considering the lousy ' acting ' in some of his recent efforts . Most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at Ebonics ( African American street slang ) . ' I da man , fo ' sho '  no , actually Steven , you sound like an arse ! With a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere , this film is a waste of time , money and effort . And the final moment , where Harlan Banks saves a Children's home from closure is enough to make you blow chunks . < br / > < br / > Damn , I just looked at the clock . I was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much , I went way over my five minutes . It's time to post this comment and get to watching something decent .
There is an interesting split in the voting for this movie ( at the moment at least ) . Those who go expecting a documentary are impressed , or at least not disappointed . I anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a re-enaction of the invasion of Gallipoli . < br / > < br / > So - if you want to see actors , gunfire and gore , this film will not suit you . If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli , without bias towards any one side ( the only enemy in these events was the War itself ) then you'll come away both impressed and sobered . I found it a very moving film , and even quite liked Captain Guy Nightingale by the end .
A stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in Japan , Like Grains of Sand delves into issues such as rape , homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way . It gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation , with it's strict conformity and facade . Typical to Japanese cinema , often what isn't said is more important that what is , so to those not versed in Japanese film and culture , beware . It can seem dull and minimalistic ( pretty much like every film to come out of Japan bar Mangas ) if you don't know what to look for . I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in Japan , it's culture and language . Considering I'm now 22 and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years , needless to say it's a powerful film . Enjoy !
I think that Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie . It's one of the only movies that , aside from some well known actors , has an unknown cast that can actually act . In my opinion , the plot is captivating . It keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life . I think that everyone would enjoy this movie . Sean Astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent . He's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves . Other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and Rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both . I hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting . If you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a Sean Astin fan you will definitely like this movie .
I remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60 ' s . It took my breath away then at young age . I was glued to my seat in front of the black and white TV . The cast was one of the best i have seen in my life . The musical was one the greatest ever have been written . Please to the Gershwin and Goldwyn Families please release this on video or DVD so that the generations now and in the future can experience what I'm sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art . Please consider , let not this great man's work go unseen for years more . I , m praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be soften and let the world see this great movie again .
Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I , called The Great War at the time , single handedly , even capturing the Kaiser , something the entire Allied armed forces were unable to do . Too bad it all turns out to be a dream , which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short ( almost a feature film at 46 minutes ) . < br / > < br / > There are inventive gags galore including Charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from home , then using the cheese as a weapon against the Germans ; Charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy ; Charlie disguising himself as a tree--one of his best sketches ever--and Charlie pretending to beat up his friend who has become a POW , then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight . < br / > < br / > One amazing feature is how much Charlie , when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a German , resembles Hitler over ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs rose to dominate German politics . Obviously Hitler patterned his appearance after Charlie's from this film .
" Blind Date " is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author Vida Hurst . Lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934 . Mickey Rooney as a mouthy little punk . He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey " family values " . Jane Darwell again plays the strong-willed mother , just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident . Ann Sothern is Kitty , who has been dating Bill ( Paul Kelly ) , but meets up with rich Bob Hartwell , played by Neil Hamilton , who may or may not be better for her . You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code - - at one point , Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house ... what a change from just a year or two prior , when anything and everything was OK . Good solid plot , but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk . It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man ; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice , or just find a man with big bucks , as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated ... ? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene . TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman ... Also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one - - Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle . Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer , who was 20 years older ; Rooney ended up being married eight times . Tyler Brooke ( Emory ) and Spencer Charters ( Pa ) both knocked themselves off in real life . The title " Blind Date " has been reused many times , for films , TV series , and even cartoons , but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one .
I would have to say this is a great movie . < br / > < br / > Mike Judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence Office Space . Hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years . That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day . Yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across . But the genuine frustration on Private Joe Bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives . < br / > < br / > If you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again . It took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it is And with said after watching it twice I am going to read a book now .
An untidy man , known as Bill , lives in a small dreary flat , with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall , and his typewriter for company . Only the man can't think of anything to write . He wanders around the streets following people , just to see where they go . Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write . He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag . He follows him for a few days . While in a cafe , the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill , and inquires why Bill is following him . The well dressed man says his name is Cobb . Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar , and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things ; although Cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal . He says he likes to let people know he has been there , and interrupted the things they take for granted . He puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers , for example . < br / > < br / > The film is told in flashbacks at times too . The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento . Bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit , on the advice of Cobb . He meets a Blonde lady in a club , who used to date the owner , a bald man , who is very dangerous , she says . We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's flat . These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us , and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion .
Well , it is standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off . It's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable . I must confess I did not really enjoy it , but I am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it . < br / > < br / > It is quite sweet , and the actors give good performances . It's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good . But the irritatingly predictable , unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back . Personally , I can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life . < br / > < br / > The chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there ; this isn't one of them .
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time , I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters , intriguing plot lines , and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got . < br / > < br / > Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at Cyprus Rhodes University . Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity . His older sister , Casey ( the show's center and soon-to-be-president of Zeta Beta Zeta , the most prestigious sorority on campus ) , isn't exactly supportive of his plans . In fact , none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds ! On top of dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced back into her life , Casey's boyfriend Evan Chambers ( soon-to-be-president of THE fraternity on campus , Omega Chi ) is cheating on her with a new ZBZ pledge ( Rebecca Logan ) , diabolical ZBZ president Frannie is pressuring her to stay with him , and she still has feelings for her slacker ex-boyfriend Cappie ( president of the party house on campus , Kappa Tau ) . These characters are joined by Calvin Owens ( an athletic , intelligent friend of Rusty's who happens to be gay ) , Dale Kettlewell ( Rusty's die-hard Christian and " possibly racist " roommate and best friend ) , and Ashleigh ( Casey's quirky best friend and confidante ) . < br / > < br / > Throughout Greek's two seasons ( or four chapters ) viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white , but " in shades of gray from here on out . " Every character makes their fair share of mistakes , but every one of them has redeemable qualities . Casey and Cappie have a complicated , but beautiful , relationship throughout the series . Rusty , Dale , and Calvin's friendship is not always perfect , but they manage to survive every obstacle that is thrown at them . Even Frannie , Rebecca , and Evan ( the show's " villains " ) are shown as human every once in a while . < br / > < br / > Greek shows college students at their best , worst , and in-between . It is a show that reveals college as what it truly is : a four-year adventure where one's morals , beliefs , and willpower are tested , compromised , and sometimes even changed . < br / > < br / > Greek has at least one season left , if not more , before it ends . I cannot wait to see where the characters end up next . Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom . If you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation , Greek is the show for you .
Yes , that's true . That movie is a horrible piece of ... you know what . Almost all fans of Sapkowski's books in Poland think the same . The truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films . It's a shame when you compare " Wiedzmin " and " Conan the Barbarian " for example . I hope no one outside Poland will ever see this nightmare .
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family ! I recommend it to people of all ages . I promise you will not be disappointed ! The characters are always so engaging , so real , you will just love them ! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life . < br / > < br / > I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book , I mean the movie was amazing ! I haven't even read the book , and guess what ? I don't care . In fact , if the movie and book are so different , then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it . < br / > < br / > I thought the acting was bloody brilliant ! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen , so evil , and so cold - you just have to hate her . Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda , a love-struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes , and goes on a wonderful adventure . And I just love all of the Snow Queen's sisters ( the Spring Witch , the Summer Princess , and Autumn Robber ) they are so fun and different in many ways . < br / > < br / > I haven't seen this movie in awhile , so forgive me if I make a minor mistake ... but there's no doubt that I will always love this movie .
Laughable . < br / > < br / > Clichéd . < br / > < br / > Overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing . < br / > < br / > Remember when MTV actually used to air music videos and other shows besides Reality Shows ? Aeon Flux ( 2005 ) is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid - 90s  featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing . Aeon , played by the lovely Charlize Theron in this adaptation , is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake . She needs to be , if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government . < br / > < br / > I love science fiction , but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like The Island ( 2005 ) and Equilibrium ( 2002 ) ( bottom of the pile ) . Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films , but amplified . That is , there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that Matrix ( 1999 ) catalyzed . The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux which earns it a few points , but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there . < br / > < br / > To make matters worse , all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch . Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director Karyn Kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional ? She doesn't know ! Let's go both ways ! Imagine you take a shotgun , load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess . This is the character of Aeon Flux . < br / > < br / > The film Aeon Flux puts forward all the ' mandatory ' ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs . society , nature vs . science , emotion vs . cold reason , etc . You've seen all of this before , and better done at that . Go read Orwell , Bradbury or Huxley , or even watch Logan's Run ( 1976 ) or Blade Runner ( 1982 ) ... anything ! Avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can . < br / > < br / > 3/10
This is a movie that I watched when I was a young girl and never forgot . It is certainly not the best movie ever made , but there is something very special about it that I can't quite put my finger on . I LOVE it . I am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy . < br / > < br / > Exactly what / Who is that mysterious witch-lady and what is her relationship with Tom ? WHY and HOW did he become a Water Baby ... why was he raised on the earth ? It is questions like these that are just eating at me ! I thought if I read the book I would get answers , but I just read an article that the book from which this story is " based " is a lot different . So I guess I'll never know what the writer was thinking ! < br / > < br / > I still love this movie though and I recently watched it with my two year old niece . She loves it too although she insists on calling it " Baby Water " for reasons unknown to me . She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares " I'm all clean . " ( You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world ! ) We watched that scene over and over . < br / > < br / > I am so glad that we can enjoy this film together ! There should be more films like this . ( But what is up with the gay seahorse ? ? ! ! )
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago , and it is now making a comeback at the local film club . It uses every cliché in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook ( Beginners Edition ) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be . You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo , brown color scale , slow pans through bombed-out environments , blank , suffering facial expressions , over-symbolic imagery , and the requisite miserable ending . < br / > < br / > It is a complete failure , an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie . The director , Aleksandr Sokurov , has excellent command of technique , but he lacks eye . He doesn't see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic . < br / > < br / > This movie is a wet dream for art film haters . It lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that there is . < br / > < br / > If it was bad in an entertaining way , it would a turkey . But for a movie that is so bad that you walk out afterwards royally p * * * ed-off , we need a new term . This movie is a Sokurov .
A film of high intelligence and activity . As well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60 ' s , the film is also TRULY a surprise in its forward-thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group . William Greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group . He asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming . First the two actors , then the crew filming the actors , then the entire set including bystanders , policemen , and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks . < br / > < br / > Greaves edits the film ( thousands of feet ) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations . Don't expect to be bored by this film . Each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film . Greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three-in-one pictures and other attention shifting methods . < br / > < br / > In the end , the film will really only be effective if it's what YOU'RE looking for : if you're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self-indulgent ego while never having a point , look elsewhere . If you're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented " reality " and the inevitable transparency that comes of it , then this is the perfect film .
OK if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp . This is NOT the movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters ( in the vane of ' cruel intentions ' or ' wild things ' ) This is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductress's movie . This is NOT the movie . < br / > < br / > However if you are looking to wast an hour of your life , this is your movie . It is badly written , badly directed , badly scored , badly filmed.It had bad special effects ... i mean really bad special effects . I think that you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol . < br / > < br / > IT REALLY IS A PRETTY BAD MOVIE . < br / > < br / > The actors were classic starlet beauties however look more like porn stars . it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains . the ' girl on girl ' scenes , which suck btw , were so LAME that there hardly worth mentioning . go watch the ' almost sex scenes ' on youtube cos that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it . < br / > < br / > A WAST OF MONEY AND TIME ! ! ! don't even pick it up , go watch ' Cruel intentions 2 ' instead - same movie without the bad special effects , bad storyline , bad writing , bad dialog and bad acting . actually i might go watch it now just to purge my mind
I saw the first House of the Dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend , so when it wasn't as bad as that , I was delightfully surprised . < br / > < br / > Unfortunately , I then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well ... and I was wrong . < br / > < br / > Apparently I'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad . < br / > < br / > I don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw , or wonder if I saw the wrong movie . < br / > < br / > Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra ' Nightingale ' Morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them . They deserve to be in better movies . < br / > < br / > The special effects were okay and some of the characters likable / hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch , but for the most part , this movie was just a waste of time . < br / > < br / > Oh and I have to ask this because I found myself asking it aloud ALL the way through the movie ... did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms ? Only once did it happen , ( zombies wandering in ) and I found that a little convenient ... soldiers walk into a room , leave the door wide open , pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it ( with the hapless " livings " being cornered with no way to escape ) and yet only once did zombies follow them in . < br / > < br / > Nitpicky ? Maybe but honestly ... if I was fighting for my life , the last thing I'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me . < br / > < br / > That is really the only thing * bothered * me throughout the movie , and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original .
If you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then Alien Vs Predator - Requiem is probably not the way to go . In summary , alien lands in typical American town , Predator lands in American town , both have a bit of a fight , US government blows up town , some people get away ... I'm sorry I think I might have spoilt the ending . Its easy to criticise someone who's being critical ; people cry out , I bet you couldn't do any better ! I bet I could ! Having made this film , watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done ; there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room .
How i deserved to watch this crap ? ? ? Worst ever . The acting was awful , when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile , once - or twice , but ... If you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives , this is the right movie . I recommend just look in a wall or something , anything else but watch this " film " . Yoy can even watch a documentary ( if you are a guy ) about pregnant women , i guarantee it will be more entertaining :) The actor in this one ( i forgot his name ) is not that bad , and i am surprised how hi accepted the role . Anyway " I want someone to eat cheese with " is the right film if you want to punish someone .
No redeeming features , this film is rubbish . Its jokes don't begin to be funny . The humour for children is pathetic , and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package . Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next . I couldn't enjoy the film at all . Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD , neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again , unlike with Monsters inc , Finding Nemo , Jungle Book , Lion King , etc . which all get frequent requests for replays .
Seriously , all these Satan comes to Earth movies always involve the Catholics . Why doesn't Lucifer ever mess with the other denominations . < br / > < br / > The plot is that Asmodeus ( Played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder ) has a plot to become human ( but wasn't he always a demon ) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child . Except maybe she isn't his sister . The plot isn't clear on this , and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem . < br / > < br / > The lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin , with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact ... Eeeewww . Her sister ( played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear Denise Crosby ) concludes that this is a sign from heaven . Praise be ! < br / > < br / > Well , the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off , in order , a truck driver , her friend's boyfriend and her friend , all being watched by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born . We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal who is running the whole thing . < br / > < br / > The ending is pretty much incomprehensible , and if you could make it that far straight through , you have a stronger stomach than I did . ( I paused the film a couple of times , it was so awful . )
Red Skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays Wally Benton who plays ' The Fox ' on a radio show . He writes the murder mysteries and as ' The Fox ' solves them . Joseph Jones ( Conrad Veidt ) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone . He kidnaps Benton , his girlfriend ( Ann Rutherford ) and another girlfriend ( Virginia Grey ) . He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... < br / > < br / > Very funny and enjoyable movie . Fast-moving ( it's only 77 minutes ) , a good script and perfect casting really puts this across . Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny , fast , handsome and intelligent . Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones . Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skelton's girlfriends . All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic . Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role . < br / > < br / > Well worth your time .
Roopa ( Kamalinee Mukherjee ) loses her parents and other family members in a gruesome car accident . She starts living on her own as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives . She has a boy friend named Rahul ( Anuj ) and is about to get married to him , but backs out due to the behavior of her future mother-in-law and due to lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend . Anand ( Raja ) joins her neighborhood . And he starts making Roopa feel comfortable and secure . The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD of the richest corporate house of AP - has chosen to reside as neighbor of Roopa and what follows next . < br / > < br / > This movie has a freshness to it which we rarely see in Indian movies to it . Although the story goes slow , you get a sense of familiarity with it . Kudos to the director shekhar kammula for such an awesome direction ! Brilliant music and background score composed by K . M . Radhakrishnan adds to the quality . Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has given a marvelous performance . I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous looks and amazing histrionics . Anand as Raja has done well too . I have watched this movie thrice now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time . It is a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here . Highly recommended ! !
When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry . It completely blew in my opinion . I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell , let's see . I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong . My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole " i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff , oh noes what is happening , oh its a dream , oh its not a dream , oh wait i see something spooky , oh never mind " - sucky storyline . Those sequels don't even require the box to be opened , or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead . The first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place . Nothing fantasy , nothing weird , the box got opened boom they came . Kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it , first because of uncle Frank . Then because she had information about the cenobites . This movie at least attempts to stick to all that , even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser . No I'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series . Now they are remaking 1 , and I don't even think I will watch it . Oh who am I kidding I probably will and probably will be disappointed ... again .
This movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art , which is good . But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting . I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding the wife , but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning Minnie Driver's character . I think that all too often Hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when , with an adult themed movie such as this , the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too . Overall , it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing .
I wouldn't call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness , so i might not be the best audience for this show . Although , being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike , this being the later . < br / > < br / > Lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy , things can be catchy , cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago ( ? ) This is the exact opposite , with a stiff script and all overacted voice-overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to . Unfortunately , since it did have a big market ahead of itself , and a lot of potential . < br / > < br / > A waste of time .
When I attended college in the early 70s , it was a simpler time . Except for a brief occurrence in 1994 , I've been totally free of the influence of illegal substances ever since and I've never regretted it ... until now . DB : TBTE has got to be , hands-down , the best movie to watch when stoned . The odd , dreamlike state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything , but I'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big doobie . ( Not that I'm recommending this , you understand . ) The soothing narration , provided , as it usually is in quality cinema , by a TB victim trapped in a painting , would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated . Plus , everything in the film is pretty organic ... from old-fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken . < br / > < br / > Now , there's also no question that the young man with the ( ahem ) " hand problem " is absolutely sailing away in the film . At one point , you just KNOW that he's going to say , " Hey ! When I move my hand , it leaves trails ! ! " Trust me ... you'll know when you get to that point . < br / > < br / > The only other thing we have to address is this : How good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots ? < br / > < br / > Definitely a must-see for horror aficionados , but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions ( if you know what I mean , and I think that you do ) . It only earns four stars because I can't actually say that it took any talent to make .
Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately ! Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion , a period vocabulary primer , karate trained hookers , crime , a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking , shoot outs , and a co-star named Queen Bee ( watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office ! ) With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movie / Dawn of The Dead / and Car Wash , you cannot go wrong . This is one to watch over and over againÉafter you put the kids to bed .
" Revenge of the Zombies " is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort . < br / > < br / > * * SPOILERS * * < br / > < br / > Traveling in the Bayou , Larry Adams , ( Robert Lowery ) and Scott Warrington , ( Mauritz Hugo ) are informed that a friend has deceased . Meeting with local Dr . Von Altermann , ( John Carradine ) he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died . While they are staying there , they realize that the help consists of zombies , reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master . As the bodies pile up , he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late . < br / > < br / > The Good News : This here gets very little right . The opening is easily it's best , as it's got several great marks for it . From where it starts , with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations , this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery . The big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long , slow and creepy shot . These here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight . The scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great . The last big positive is the really fun ending . With the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many Universal attempts , this one fits in with that style . From the creepy reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp , this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real positives . < br / > < br / > The Bad News : This one here only has a couple flaws , but they are major ones . The first one is the film's major boredom from inactivity . Almost nothing happens in here , mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else . There's only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies , yet there's nothing here that devotes any action to the film . This one simply doesn't have any action , and that's what hurts the film . It rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going , and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is . The last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies . Those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures , and they really only serve several scenes . This here doesn't treat the zombies as threats , making them even less frightening . Little screen-time , nonthreatening nature and un-modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one . These here are what really hurt the film . < br / > < br / > The Final Verdict : With bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching , this one here is a curious effort . Those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is , while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot . < br / > < br / > Today's Rating-PG : Mild Violence
In the only act of commonsense they have ever made , the NSW Film & Television Office refused to fund this film . The Producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to Victoria . Apart from the lost work for technicians , NSW were lucky not to have been involved ... < br / > < br / > The film fails on just about every level . The post modernism fails , the casting fails ( what is Rose Byrne's character all about ? which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did Hugo Weaving channel ? what the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing ? ) and the story is a clichéd mess of contradictions . In fact , the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line . < br / > < br / > It might have had a chance if the " pop culture meets depression " style was better thought out and executed . If the casting was quirkier , if the style was less serious ... if just about everything was different . < br / > < br / > Apart from the usual excellence in costume , design & cinematography ( like most Australian films ) , the film is just a total miscue . < br / > < br / > At a reported budget in excess of $ 7m , " The Tender Hook " is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded . Compare this mess with " Noise " ( under $ 2m ) , or " Cedar Boys " ( under $ 1m ) and you get the idea . The tough , interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby , overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks . < br / > < br / > The funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as Hugo Weaving's character at the end of the film .
I thought Nick Gomez's look at the gritty streets of New Jersey , where car-jackings are at an all-time high , was both thought-provoking and entertaining . This is just as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim . I thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable , it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric , whether on purpose or by raw coincidence . I liked this movie a lot , an underrated gem i found on TV and glad i caught it . Go watch this movie if you get a shot . If they don't have a DVD , they should release one . Well done Nick Gomez . IMDb Rating : 5.9 . My Rating : 9/10
My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie . I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me . < br / > < br / > The movie " Babas bilar " must be just about the worst film I ever seen . I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK , but somewhere on the line something happened . What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper . Put to practice both script and the cast fails to deliver . There are to much action , it happens to much things and you can't help wonder why it happens . And then the cast , the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start to cry . < br / > < br / > If you have to much time at hand I would say you can see it . If not - don't .
This is one of my most favorite movies of all time . Pretty pathetic you say ? Well , yeah it is . But Chris is incredibly , incredibly funny . His innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films . Look at both motel scenes , when Spade gets caught with his zipper down , and the other : " JUST GO AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ! ! ! "
i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it ' s got pretty much everything a western should have.there ' s gunfights , action , chases on horseback.there ' s a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at.there ' s some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan , who plays Uncle Willie McLeod , a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool , but is actually aware of everything going on.Randolph Scott plays the town Sheriff , and Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith , a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways . i liked the different mix of characters in the movie . i didn't find it always fast paced , but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943 , it is in colour . 8/ 10
You'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie . This movie is an exercise in over-acting ( very bad over-acting ) to situations that made out to be more than what they are . I won't give away the plot , but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back . The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini !
I expected a good movie . What I got was an even better movie . The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible . Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once ! < br / > < br / > The movie works , because the actors play their parts perfectly . Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm ; Kevin James is hilarious , and Eva Mendes ... well , let's just say she plays that bitch / sweet / annoying role to the best of her ability . < br / > < br / > What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable . He just was ! ! The " date doctor " had all the right moves , said everything in the most perfect of ways , and never ever went over the top . < br / > < br / > The funny parts are hilarious ... and the cute , romantic parts are unforgettable . < br / > < br / > I totally recommend this movie . And no , it is not a chick flick .
My sister , a friend and I went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of September . We had all seen the first " Jackass " movie a while back , and we all enjoyed it . We were really looking forward to Number Two . < br / > < br / > We were not disappointed . < br / > < br / > From start to finish I was laughing hysterically . It is equal parts shocking and amusing , however , and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches . It is obscene , but it is also groundbreaking American cinema ... well , perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum's stuck to ice sculptures , but it IS groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not , things that no other " decent " American movie released nation-wide would dare show us . < br / > < br / > There was only one scene in particular that I felt was unnecessarily obscene , and it involved a horse - I'll not elaborate . < br / > < br / > I laughed , I nearly gagged , and I came damn-close to crying ( out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball , not sadness ) . In my humble opinion , " Jackass : Number Two " is THE film of ' 06 . < br / > < br / > Does that make me a jackass ? Perhaps . But if it does , I could really care less .
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife . I suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me . < br / > < br / > But putting that aside , I found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also , the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead Vincent Spano . < br / > < br / > I have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies I missed during that decade . It has been my pet peeve that eighties nostalgia buffs seem to focus on the same core canon of films usually featuring the brat pack actors and actresses and neglecting the other films like Creator that have fallen through the cracks . But in the case of this feature I have to say I can understand it . Not all of these eighties films were magical and Creator is proof of this .
How unfortunate , yet also fortunate , that two films about pot-holing - The Cave and The Descent - should arrive at much the same time . Sadly for The Descent its release in the UK on 7th of July coincided with the very day of the London underground tube / metro terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 and injured hundreds - not a particularly good night / weekend to pop out to the cinema , especially to see a scary-as-sheesh film about likable women being trapped in a deep , dark , claustrophobic underground caving system . The two movies have virtually the same elements - a half dozen or so characters , lost in a previously unexplored caving system , with no-one outside aware they are trapped down there . Lots of water , caverns , danger ... then ultimately some vicious human-like or human-derived creatures determined to prey upon them . Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal , entirely unbelievable , more Alien-esquire sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror , or drama . The comparatively minuscule-budgeted British film ( filmed in southern England though set in the Appalachians ) is five-pair-of-pants terrifying , a heart-stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of screenings early in shock . It knocks off the girls in any old order - you genuinely have no idea what to expect next - surely not her ! The Descent is also lit in naturalistic manner , making it all the more scary , unlike the laughably lit Cave which resembles a giant magical Christmas Santa's grotto , with cathedral-sized room after room dazzling in gloriously blue light from ... who knows where , while the cavers torches are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the granite-jawed heroes ( each more puppet-like than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation ) . Fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too , yet despite this the impossibly deep-voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger , drama , or anything worthy of a horror film - it's strictly PG rated . And in this instance the actors peg out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to - i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character , only getting Piper Perabo out of sequence . The Cave script is entirely by-numbers , unlike Shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in under a week ... Take a typical exchange between the ' good buddy ' white and black leads that goes ; " how many times have we been in this situation before bud ? " - " too many " ( replies Morris Chesnut ) . I swear , you could hear my suburban London audience gasp at the obviousness . The scariest thing about The Cave is that at the end there's a clear opening for ' the sequel ' - ' The Cave 2 : Overground ' or whatever . Be afraid , be very afraid ... Or instead catch The Descent and be truly afraid , very very very afraid . RR
When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released , plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film , particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power . But it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at Three Mile Island to shut those critics up . < br / > < br / > Fonda and Douglas are the L . A . news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant . Douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass ; but the TV station will not air the footage , fearing a massive lawsuit . It is thus up to Fonda and Douglas to get at the truth , despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident . < br / > < br / > But a conscientious shift supervisor ( Jack Lemmon ) has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure . He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that , though it would be extremely costly and lengthy , if repairs aren't made , the next accident could be apocalyptic . But he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story . The result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political , technological , and human interest stories together in one disturbing package . < br / > < br / > While obviously quite politically liberal in nature , THE CHINA SYNDROME , well directed and co-written by James Bridges ( THE PAPER CHASE ) , is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together . Fundamentally , nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect . That is what the film is saying ; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way , it says it brilliantly .
This was a sordid and dreary mess . I needed a shower when it was over . It goes something like this - some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case . She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society , and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information . Since the detective is an attractive woman , of course she is horny and intrigued ( which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women ) . What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting , just depressing and yucky . Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective , and Julian Sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross-dressing psychiatrist , which is why it escapes a one-star rating .
This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The only advantage seeing this movie is that the next movie can't possibly be worse . It's childish as hell ( but Children aren't allowed )
It is inconceivable to me how ANYONE could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie . I'd say it's the worst movie I've seen in years and I see a lot of them . Maybe I've forgotten junior high ? It's also very hard to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels to did such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing . Seems like ever since he did Dumber , he's gone into the tank . Can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk ?
Seriously , I don ´ t really get why people here are bashing it . I mean , < br / > < br / > the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd . The good news is , the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of Army of Darkness . < br / > < br / > Especially in the second half of the film , when the little killer snowballs attack , I laughed my ass off . For example , the put one of the little creeps into a blender ( a la Gremlins 1 ) and mix it . After that , it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice " That was fun ! " . < br / > < br / > Bottom line - incredible movie , rent it .
For me , it just didn't seem like GI Joe at all . When I watched it as a kid , I just didn't care for it . In fact the part I liked best about this one was the opening credits . They change so many facts around and turn the story around as well . Cobra Commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in Antarctica or somewhere that is frozen . Though I always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here . There is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie , but for me it just ruins what I watched the series for in the first place .
Jack Brooks ' quirks are , at first , somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie . < br / > < br / > I found myself getting angrier and angrier as I was duped into seeing this one through to the end , in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super-tedious wait . < br / > < br / > The climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time . < br / > < br / > Normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre . But the fact that the wait-time-before-action index is so high , should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development . < br / > < br / > Not so . < br / > < br / > While not without its initial charms , this movie ultimately infuriates , and disappoints . < br / > < br / > Wish I could get all that setup time back , to reinvest it into something that pays off .
I first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality . It is one of the most touching films I have ever seen , though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful , if you will . Anyway , one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art , comparable to the Chirico's or Bernard Buffet's paintings . < br / > < br / > The music forms a perfect background for the story , especially U2 ' s one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene . As for the casting - I cannot be objective since I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others . < br / > < br / > However , the very fact that many people ( critics and those sophisticated in cinema ) criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time . No doubt , the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous . But this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film . The second novel ( when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what ? ) . Apparently , it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of Malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot . < br / > < br / > Other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot , which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them . The scene when Jean Reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible . The feeling of moist air and fine haze , which is being spread by the first " Ferrera " scene can literally be sensed through the screen . No doubt , Antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades . My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic , deep and meaningful - I guess that it the most Antonioni-like one in the whole movie - almost a parable.Probably , the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Ghotic Italian town , with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements , fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals ... It was laconic but really touching . < br / > < br / > I hope that my impressions and comments on the movie , however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it ( it works better with the home theater , having somebody caring by your side , than in the movie theater ) . Enjoy . < br / > < br / > I beg your pardon for the imperfect English and any possible misspellings
Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver . Even though his background was mostly comedy , he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better ( though there is a lot of humour in this ) . Hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent especially since his character is supposed to be English but that's just a minor thing . < br / > < br / > All the villains are equally well cast : James Fox , Edward Fox , Peter O'Toole , Warwick Davis , John Standing , etc . Despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants , they are 100 % believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear e . g . the Lilliputians ' unremitting suspicion of Gulliver , Grildrig the ( giant ) dwarf's hatred of him for usurping his position as court jester , Dr . Bates ' attempt to have Gulliver proved insane so he can marry Mary . < br / > < br / > Mary Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver ( another 17th Century English character with an American accent but never mind ) . She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does , he is talking about tiny people , giants , a flying island and talking horses ! Mary , despite the strong fantasy element in the story , is a very believable character . < br / > < br / > The special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy . It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall . < br / > < br / > The cameos are great as well : Omar Sharif , Richard Wilson , Sir John Gielgud , Kristin Scott Thomas , Ned Beatty . All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson's superb acting ability . < br / > < br / > The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things : a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive , disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is . Gulliver and Mistress ' study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos . < br / > < br / > The best version of " Gulliver's Travels " by far and one of the best mini-series ever .
When it opened in London during the Christmas season of 1969 this musical version of James Hilton's famous story was drubbed by the critics . The same reception greeted it when it opened in the US , prompting MGM to withdraw its " Roadshow " status and cut almost all of its songs . What a mistake ! ! ! < br / > < br / > Watched years later , when the trendy world of the 60 ' s and 70 ' s has turned in upon itself , this version of GOODBYE , MR.CHIPS is a total delight . First of all , as " Chipping " , Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances . To watch him turn from the hated , cold , emotionless Latin teacher at a boy's boarding school , to a man who finally can see the colors in the world ( after falling for and marrying musical star Catherine Briskit ) is to see a genius at work . ( If you can , watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA , THE LION IN WINTER , MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS back to back over a number of days or weeks . Then you will see what a truly great actor O'Toole is , and how magnificent he is in CHIPS . ) < br / > < br / > Catherine , as played by the glowing Petula Clark , at the height of her popularity , is ever man's dream ; beautiful , loving , understanding , with a great voice to boot . Most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly , while the direction by the late Herbert Ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life . < br / > < br / > Okay , this film may be a bit too romantic for some people , but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted , sung , and directed love story , look no further . ( If you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version , better yet . I am anxiously awaiting CHIPS ' debut on DVD . )
Bill , Jeremy Theobald , is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet . Bill also has an odd and strange habit , he likes to follow people . < br / > < br / > Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway , metro , and follows them as if he were their shadow . Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine ? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her ? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself ? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop . < br / > < br / > One day Bill follows Cobb , Alex Haw , home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb . Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it . < br / > < br / > Amazingly good low-budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in Hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic " Momento " some two years later that has already become a major cult movie . < br / > < br / > " Following " is actually a much better movie then " Momento " because it's a conventional and easy to follow story . Compared to " Momento's " which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated . Whats makes " Following " so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it . The movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like " Momento " did . " Following " is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending , if you watch the movie again and notice the clues , that you'll ever see . < br / > < br / > Made with an unbelievably small budget of $ 6,000 . 00 , thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks , with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour , 71 minutes , long . Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't ; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars .
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 , this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria . However , three things complement the story , making this an extremely good movie . < br / > < br / > First , the actors use the actual languages of their roles . The Russian soldiers speak only Russian ; the Hungarians only Hungarian ; the Germans only German , except to the minimal extent to tell the story . Since Debra Kerr is English , she speaks only English , and , of course , Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English . As a result , the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount . The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he / she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them . Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience , and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages , the audience is never at a loss for following the film . No subtitles are necessary . < br / > < br / > Second . I was in Hungary in 1995 , and I'm telling you , this movie has it right on . From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes , the realism is incredible . If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie , I ate at its double . I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village . ( Actually , the film was shot in Austria ) . < br / > < br / > Third , and most important , this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner ( after The King and I ) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified . Of course , Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship , so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one , but that is the quality of the film . Don't miss this one .
Pretty darn good for a French film . I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films , and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work . French cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films , and leaves the shoot-em-ups and star vehicles to Hollywood . That is probably a good business strategy , as no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects . Films about film-making are often a bore , as it has little resonance for people not in the business . But this one held my interest much more than I thought it would . In spite of the title , ( oddly in English ) it really isn't much of a comedy , in spite of a few droll moments . I've only seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films , but she shows a generous amount of talent and range , from the action / psychological drama of " La Femme Nikita " to the wry comedy of " Innocent Blood " . This film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman , yet is still compelling on the screen . Kudos also to Roxane Mesquida , with whom I was unfamiliar . She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film , whose talent is drawn out at the end . If you don't HAVE to have car chases and explosions to be entertained , check this one out .
Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner ( as Joel Gregory ) and Kate Jackson ( as Donna Gregory ) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress " Lorna Love " ( actually , silent film star Harold Lloyd's house ) . Mr . Wagner and Ms . Jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star's biography . Wagner has a personal interest in the project , since his father was once the famed star's lover . Mysterious events unfold , and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde , who is " perfectly preserved " in a crypt on the estate ; moreover , the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband , and murdering Jackson ! < br / > < br / > This is very much a " Night of Dark Shadows " variation , co-starring genuine " Dark Shadows " alumni Kate Jackson , who knows and plays her part well . Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity . Sylvia Sidney ( as Mrs . Josephs ) sidesteps Grayson Hall . Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker ( or Diana Millay ) . Bill Macy ( as Oscar Payne ) is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen ( in a Dan Curtis production ) . < br / > < br / > There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell , John Carradine , and Dorothy Lamour . Ms . Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett , which begs the question : why didn't producer Aaron Spelling get more of the original " Dark Shadows " regulars ? < br / > < br / > Director E . W . Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband ; he worked with Ms . Blondell on " Here Come the Brides " , and with Jackson on " The Rookies " . " Death at Love House " has , arguably , a tighter storyline than the " Night of Dark Shadows " film ; it differs in the movie star angle ; and , in its " Father Eternal Fire " ending , it more closely resembles the TVseries ' " Laura the Phoenix " storyline . < br / > < br / > * * * Death at Love House ( 9/3 / 76 ) E . W . Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner , Kate Jackson , Sylvia Sidney
This frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager , but now find rather distasteful . In the case of May-September attachments , doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust , or an inability to face the reality of aging , or both . And the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she ( or he ) lacked as a child . These underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now ; there is also something rather predatory about them . < br / > < br / > Dick Powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story . He was , at fifty , attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager . But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of " gift " to the morally upright and honest screenwriter , as a subject for him to study . Her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve . Anne Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful , but brittle fiancée , and handled her small role deftly . < br / > < br / > Some of the dialogue was quite amusing , too , so it's not a total washout . < br / > < br / > 5/10
The biggest problem that the TV program Key West faced was that it was advertised wrong . If you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how , and be sorely disappointed . It was a vastly more complex show than that . < br / > < br / > I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew hit , and I think I actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in Rum Runners . Of course , that was before the show hit . I did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times , and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too . HE was a real local . Yes , I'd love to see this on DVD .
I have never seen this movie on its own , but like many others who have already commented , I saw it as an episode of MST 3K . Really terrible 70s television schlock . But someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island . < br / > < br / > And to the person who asked whether there were ANY good movies made in the 70s , I want to remind her that it was a golden age for American film with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese first coming into their own . Not to mention little things like Star Wars ( 1977 ) . Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far .
I've become a big fan of the Carpenters , and I didn't really enjoy this movie . < br / > < br / > I feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through . I wasn't overly fond of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal ; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide , which it clearly wasn't . Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses , I thought the movie portrayed Agnes ( their mother ) as being terrible . < br / > < br / > I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way , such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier ; I thought the metaphor ( so-to-speak ) there was rather effective . When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving ( which is probably the wrong word ) as well . < br / > < br / > Overall , I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly , quirky side--her genuine personality . Even as the focus of the film , there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia ( though of course no one can really know ) , and almost made it seem baseless . The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story , in my opinion . < br / > < br / > I would assume that they changed her husband's name / profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him ( there were some bad terms there ) , but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes . On this note , I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids , which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband . < br / > < br / > On the whole , it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease . I feel that such a legend deserves / deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice .
I've never seen a show with as much story , mystery , suspense , and hard-hitting excitement before . i barley watch TV anymore but i own every season of this show and it's amazing . every episode is extremely well-acted , written and plotted . towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far-fetched for being in a prison , but the actors pulled it off . Sopranoes sucks huge compared to OZ . in fact , any show that is on a cable network , HBO or not just cant hold a candle to OZ . i wish it would come back for one more season . if it did happen , they would probably kill off every character on the show , but hey , we all gotta go sometime . as far as the characters , i'd say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites . both were hardley in a scene together , but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of anyones , except Beechers of course , but still ... anyway , best show ever , best network ever , some of the best actors ever , PERIOD !
Fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot-wise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad , but the premise is engaging , the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing . It's a shame the story is such a wreck . There are a couple of places where I had no idea what just happened , it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you'd got there . The movie is poor at explaining things and some things don't make a lot of sense , but the movie moves along breezily so its flaws barely register . Not a great movie by any means , but definitely a fun one .
this particular title is very interesting . the whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG , which is really cool . three magical swords , three clans , a horrible demon , a political power , yotoden has it all . the animation is decent , but a little grainy , the story is top notch , and the fight scenes are real cool . one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters . they are pretty freaky . if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll , yotoden is the one to see .
When a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of social scum , have had enough of their sh * * infested cell , they spot a rat and look for the hole . Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls , take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization . What soon follows is not surprising . Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake . It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of . < br / > < br / > Loosely based on The Great Escape , 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year . Running at right around 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless . The beautiful , yet subtle , use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story . The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda ( Blue Spring , Porno Star ) , is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters . As quickly as each character grasps their dream , it's as quick as it's torn from them . Now , all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director , yet props must go to the actors as well . This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom . Ryuhei Matsuda ( the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition ) delivers a stellar performance , and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen . < br / > < br / > I must give props to Artsmagic DVD as well . This is the 6th film of theirs I've seen now , and they seem to get better and better each DVD . The sound quality is perfect and the picture ; clean and crisp . It's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer , so the discs from theses cats are nice . < br / > < br / > Bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers ' world wide . Keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 SOULS ; it's really amazing film to watch .
" Joe " is one of those movies where , although you think that it might go along smoothly , ends up hitting you like ... I can't come up with an analogy . It showed not only that America's long-standing idea of unity was moot , but also the various aspects within our society . Melissa Compton ( Susan Sarandon ) is the ultimate flower child , while her father Bill ( Dennis Patrick ) is a clean-cut executive . One day , Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend . In the immediate aftermath , Bill gets acquainted with Joe Curran ( Peter Boyle ) , an ultra-right-wing , rabidly racist working stiff . As a result , the two of them end up associating more and more with the hippies , whom Bill finds unpleasant and Joe outright hates . But in the end , everything has dead serious consequences . < br / > < br / > True , some parts of the movie are a little bit dated , but it's a good juxtaposition of America's two sides during the Vietnam War . And rest assured , the residual effects of all that will probably never go away .
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line . There is not one ... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this blah movie . < br / > < br / > The Crows ... Hitchcock did it superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this film falls short of a well done attack scene . The creepy crawly boy ... The Grudge did it and did it better . The psycho ... done in Cold Creek Manor most recently , however it has been done to death . No pun intended . Disconnected / rebellious teen who no one listens to ... about a dozen films have used this one right down to Beetlejuice . The oozy stuff from the basement ... can you say Amnityville Horror ? Doors opening unbidden ... What Lies Beneath did it with much more flair . Creepy farmhouse ... too numerous to mention . < br / > < br / > The backdrop of metaphysics - - which should have been the central focus , gets lost once you figure out what is happening , which by the way is pretty early on . < br / > < br / > One thing ( of many actually ) they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked down the ooze in the basement , so they really don't have a body . < br / > < br / > Overall ... DON'T BOTHER
i have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same . this one is no exception . the ghost is a black haired girl , that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead .. the difference is just the motive for the haunting . the rest is the same as every time : black haired girl , strange things happening with some media ( photos ) , creepy acting . while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before . some scenes where quite nice though , i'll give it 3 out of 10
This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival . It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson , using many famous faces who sit for interviews , rarely seen TV performances and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work . There's even a few shots from " Son Of Dracula " . This movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices , the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music . It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed . His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious wish for self-destruction . As a bonus , you even get Eric Idle performing the song with wrote for Nilsson's final album during the closing credits . It's funny , it's sad . It's not in general release . If this picture plays anywhere near where you live , see it !
This relatively obscure Hong Kong " minorpiece " is the perfect desert island movie for video age peeping toms ( at least its first half is ) . Every set-up , every scene , every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's skirt , stare down at her breasts , gaze at her bottom and leer at her tight crotch . What it's establishing is the lead character's perverted proclivities , of course ( ! ) < br / > < br / > Genre stalwart Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic daydreams and outrageous fantasies . All involve scantily clad , sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude on their minds . < br / > < br / > The plot is thickened by a homicidal subplot , voodoo doll skewering and a little rape and pillage . < br / > < br / > Some of the sex scenes are fairly hot and the gore is liberal , but the supernatural elements introduced into the second half feel half-baked and the plot developments are ludicrous . < br / > < br / > Clearly , producer of garish garbage Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of theaters . < br / > < br / > The arty title sequence did not fool this jaded punter .
This was a Hindi movie . Hindi = Horrible . reasons : cheap dialogues , cheap special effects , cheap directing + stretching a 2 hr max movie into 3 hrs . < br / > < br / > % ^ ^ ^ spoiler ... little bit % % % < br / > < br / > Specifically for this movie : 1 . dialogues are not funny . they are cheesy , and cheap . Though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him , comedy was not funny at all ! I laughed only 3 times during this movie . 2 . first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half . the 2nd half was the actual story / movie . the first half was time pass / build up . 3 . The characters are not developed properly at all . paresh rawal is smart in the first half , an idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie . we don't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay , and govinda . their characters are stupid nothing more . they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties . Jokes are funny , but they are not funny in a very serious scene . the characters of the gang and the drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies . there is nothing new about those characters . Again , they are shown to be stupid for being funny . however , stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie . the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story . 4 . special effects were crap . at the end , ppl r fallin off the ladder of a fire truck . you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air . secondly , ppl start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around . ppl can't fly off a ladder when its moving ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity . 5 . the whole movie was dubbed . all the dialogues were recorded after the movie . The actors ' lips hardly synced to the dialogues . < br / > < br / > There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap , but i can't remember them . look at this masterpiece of crappy Indian movies by non-intelligent , even stupid , director yourself and you will agree with my review . ppl who like Hindi movies , please increase your expectations for decent quality in Hindi movies . < br / > < br / > Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad . I like some . i did not like this one . < br / > < br / > 1.5 / 10 ( 1.5 for the effort by akshay and lara )
It's just one of those films , you're either love it or hate it , my girlfriend and me loved it , told my brother to rent it and he hated it , said it was too flashy and colloquial , then again he only usually goes to see big action movies , so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed . There were some great new talent ( I'd never heard of the leads before anyway ) ? Des Brady ( the directors brother ? ) was especially good . Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him . A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart , if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original . Yashimo . Brixton in the UK .
It was riveting . I just could not look away . As the movie rolled on I started to feel that it was powerful and confronting , but i had no idea how much more intense it would get . < br / > < br / > The movie gives an insight into what unfortunately is everyday life for a lot of school kids . Some of us live outside that environment and would walk by and not know what is happening . < br / > < br / > Parents need to see this film in particular , just to see a glimpse of what their kids go through . Often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial , but unfortunately to a high schooler they are massive . And unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy . < br / > < br / > Definitively a must see for all .
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge of movie making , a mixed bag of aspiring actors , and a lot of determination , yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special ( in a bad way , not a nostalgic good way ) . I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free . Thankfully , I found it in a discount bin somewhere . Sure , there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing , but it is a market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor B movies out there . Even more so now in this day and age . < br / > < br / > The only people I would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers . First , I would recommend that they watch the special feature MAKING OF thing included on the disc . See the film crews enthusiasm , their hard work , joy , and very high opinions of their own product . THEN watch the movie . Within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong . Bored , I went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried , but just don't know enough about what they are doing . They knew enough to have fun , but in the long run , without necessary skills , this interprets to : They knew enough to be dangerous . This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie ( as apposed to a more decent one I guess ) . A couple of the actors did ok , and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo ( real or fake tattoo I know not ) was probably the best and most natural and I hope he makes it . But their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie , bad script , and so-so directing principles . If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters , studying successfully proven camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better , and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so ( according to the very indulgent documentary ) then maybe this could have been more of a film . Instead , it's a film that has a feeling of some potential , and has a few moments in it ( due more to the genre than the film itself ) , but ends up showing nearly every frame , WHAT NOT TO DO . If you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like , watch Phantasm or even Laserblast . If you want a glorified home movie ( no joke ) , get Bog Creatures .
I thought this movie was great , if you didn't take it too seriously . Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston , MA . I also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength . Plus Mr . Myagi was so sweet , I wish he'd teach me karate !
I haven't had a chance to view the previous film , but from what I've read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one , although I doubt that is possible . I'm a huge fan of the " Zombie " genre , and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures , that for all intents and purposes are human , as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head . That said , HOTD 2 takes the " Zombie " movie to an all new low . < br / > < br / > Without giving any big spoilers ( which I really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie ) I would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries Special Forces . Gomer Pile could have probably survived longer than the " Spec Ops " soldiers in this film . For crying out loud they should have called them the Special Education Forces instead . If you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies , at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses . I understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team , but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement . < br / > < br / > The writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for , and the idea has merit , if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making . I mean come on , zombie films aren't exactly " high art " , and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills , but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters . If you are a zombie movie fan like me , please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one .
I ` m in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can ` t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn ` t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? < br / > < br / > Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn ` t made by the director of MEMENTO ?
SPOILER ! ! ! Mind Ripper hmmm ... I had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about Giovanni Ribisi . I thought Giovanni Ribisi hadnt done any horrors so I checked into it . I saw " the outpost " ( mind ripper ) I checked on my Tivo for it . There was an air date on Sci Fi . So I was set . I got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this ? A freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling ! Nothing is scary about this movie at all ! If anything its funny ! Funny how low the budget is , funny how predictable it is , funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it DIDNT make . Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb . It is so stupid . They killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the " monster " is on it . They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground . And < br / > < br / > - GASP - The killer ending , Its Still Alive ! WOOHHH ! Scary ! wooohhh ! Sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours . < br / > < br / > Bottom Line : You have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time . Mind ripper isnt the suggestion . I'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time . < br / > < br / > OVERALL GRADE : F - - - - - - - - - - ( ENTERNAL )
This is a catastrophe movie set in London . Starting multiple hurricane , superstorm and tornadoes on Scotland are displaced towards East , downing England coast and later the South . After several hours of heavy rainful , the London barrier above Thames is short from running over , and it paves the way for disaster . Then a colossal tidal-wave travel relentless down East causing devastation and lives of millions of Londoners are in danger . At the center of the story is a climatologist ( Tom Courtenay ) a climatologist who tries to save London from the effects of giant wave , trying to convince the authorities that the town dike was unsafe , furthermore a marine engineer ( Robert Carlyle ) and his ex-wife Samantha ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) . They are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea . Meantime the secret government agency HQ ruled by Nash ( Joanne Whalley ) under direct orders of deputy Minister ( David Suchet ) attempt to control many displaced and avoid more dead , approximately 200.000 . They have a little time to save London from total catastrophe . < br / > < br / > Perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with alright acting . Magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts catastrophe and excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as ex-matrimony rekindling their love . The movie packs impressive flood scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer generator special effects , better than the classic of the 70s , such as ' Earthquake , Inferno Towering ' and similarly to ' Armaguedon and Day after tomorrow ' . Although isn't a clear denounce , we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming which originates the ozone hole . The motion picture is well directed by Tony Mitchell . I would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies . Another adaptations about floods , are the following : ' Flood ( 1976 ) ' directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey ; ' Hard rain ( 1998 ) ' directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater ; ' Flood : a river's rampage ( 1979 ) ' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title ' The Godfather of Gore ' . While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds , and isn't all that gory ; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller , and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made ! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films , everything about this Giallo is great . The plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up . The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys . Shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes , a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own . Martelli soon encounters various suspects , including a sexy young lady named Patricia , a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them . < br / > < br / > While this film may not feature loads of gore , it does have two of Fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it . The nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery , while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs . Don't Torture a Duckling features an absolutely great Italian cast . Barbara Bouchet ( a personal favourite of mine ) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia , and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films . Tomas Millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of Irene Pappas , Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel . The cinematography on display is stunning and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene . The story plays out slowly , and it's always interesting as Fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line . There isn't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer ; but Fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and Don't Torture a Duckling does climax on a high . Overall , it's a shame that Fulci didn't make more films like this . Don't Torture a Duckling is his out and out best work and I insist that every Giallo fans sees it !
The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman . Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star . Well , OK , Amy Adams deserves a wee smidgen , but the smidgenometer doesn't seem to be working , so I'll stick with 3 . Tom Hanks ... nothing . Julia Roberts ... nothing . Mike Nichols ... do you see a trend yet ? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG , not a chance . < br / > < br / > I could rant on for several paragraphs about the way Charlie Wilson's War glosses over history , morality , legitimacy and so on , but I don't think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of Aaron Sorkin fans . The rest of you , beware.Spend your movie money elsewhere . < br / > < br / > Still , if you're looking for a pithy comment , here's mine . You can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage , but it changes nothing . Garbage is garbage and so is Charlie Wilson's War .
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it . Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous . Although a musical , I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well . As far as her dancing , I think she was excellent . Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it , Betty Grable was an excellent dancer . The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted . Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly . Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever ? You'll have to watch the film to find out !
This movie was so bad I don't know where to begin , apparently neither did the filmmakers . It starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching TV . The news tells of a corn maze that's open for Halloween . He has a " vision " of God knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this " vision " How you ask ? I don't know , and as I said before neither do the filmmakers . They're simply visions of people's feet . How did he get these " visions " ? It's never explained , we're just supposed to go along with it . He enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside , and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him , one time they actually run into him . What does he do ? Does he chase after them ? No . He stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past . Do the girls stop ? No . They run off then ask " Was that Dad ? " Then someone dressed as demon jumps on the " star " ( the Dad character ) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze . The police are called and after finding the " star " ( which is a really bad term to use ) they cuff him . They cuff his hands in front of him , so that he can find something to pick the lock with , which he does . First off , anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back , and secondly why does this " average guy " seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs ? Well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the " star's " wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction . By the way , it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down . Leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze . Considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers , why not . Besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well . By the way , the " star " who goes by the name of " Walker " , we figure out it's his last name , a name in which his wife even calls him by . Somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging . I say ' somehow ' because I couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place . He finds a locket , what does it mean ? Nothing to anyone who watches this , but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime . Somebody killed their kids in his " vision " and I guess that's what he's going on , real detective work . And by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze , one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film , which is why he's looking for his girls . Every time we see the killer , or rather the killer's feet , we hear a weird robotic sound , like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical . Why do we hear this sound ? Is it in anyway related to ... anything ? Again , who knows ? Certainly not the filmmakers . The peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when " Walker " yells out " Hey you , Mr . Bad Man ... I'm gonna get you . " Another time his wife is attacked by the " Bad Man " at the entrance to the corn maze , which like I mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen . The " Bad Man " calls " Walker " on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well . " Walker " can only reply with " Hey . HEY ! " before dropping his phone and running off . With no one on the other end to talk to , the killer drops his phone too , he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film , losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats . If this script wasn't written by a child I'd be surprised . Opps it wasn't . It was written , directed , and produced by the same guy . And not only that , he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well , where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield , that waste 90 % of the film time . In the end " Walker " uses the cuffs to cuff the " Bad Man " , who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that " Walker " had picked it with . Apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield . But after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids " Walker " kills the " Bad Man " , and everything is right with the world again . Now in reality this makes " Walker " a murderer , he's killed a man who " Supposedly " murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his . He knows this , not because of proof , but because of his visions . He never found a body , nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze . And the locket ? He gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls . No proof . So he kills a man without any tangible reason . I can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one . It must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company . I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project five times than see this film again . The actors should be ashamed . The director / producer / writer / cameraman should also be ashamed . In fact the entire production company should be ashamed . If there is anyone associated with this film , please reply . What were you thinking ?
Take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like . It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie . To be fair , there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie . I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me . So sorry . I really tried to like it . There didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here . Didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way . This isn't the worst movie in the world . " Open Water " holds that title for now .
I have been away from Istanbul for the last 10 years . During that time I constantly lived in London . When I have seen the movie I realised how much I am Istanbuler . I am not just from Turkey I am a part of Turkey . One of my part is Istanbul , the sound of the Istanbul , the people of the Istanbul . < br / > < br / > Probably Faith Akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but I must say it is more than that . It is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics , cultures , approaches , politics , ethnics into a delicious pot ... < br / > < br / > As we all know Turkey to be precise Istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city . As one of the band member said Istanbul is a bi-cultural city . But much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city . It shows we've never been one . < br / > < br / > This movie will catch from very first second . Music is excellent , people are fascinating . Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu . Singers , band members ! It is nice to see you all at a small cinema in Wood Green .
Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama , but if she approaches her role with aplomb , she's alone in doing so . Blake Edwards ' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn't know what tone to aim for , and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle . Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 , and elephantine productions like " Star ! " and this film really tarnished Andrews ' reputation , leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until " The Tamarind Seed " came along . I've always thought Julie Andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady ; her strong voice could really command attention , and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive . Husband / director Edwards seems to realize this , but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario . Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn't a good partner for Edwards , and neither man has his heart in this material . Beatty's script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease . * 1/2 from * * *
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if the film were a travelogue , but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry , that is not good enough . The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love , but its approach is stereotypical , indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species . As with many films , one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter . Alas , we probably will never know .
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man ( which more or less takes place in the desert ) . It also models some of the bizarre humor ( and especially eccentric trail of characters ) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy , ' After Hours . ' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy , a metaphor of temptation and redemption , Gus ( played well by Jordan Christopher Michael ) , a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank , steals a Mustang , and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents . It begins as a trip through salvation ( which is apparent in the scenes with John Diehl ) , but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called Motorama , he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence . He travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting Motorama cards from participating gas stations , just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize . < br / > < br / > Along the way , he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as Flea who plays a high strung busboy , Meatloaf who plays a crazy biker , and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron ( a Seinfeld regular ) as two violent kidnappers . < br / > < br / > The DVD rerelease can be very deceptive , as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise . The newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... which , despite the size of her picture on the DVD cover , is actually only about a 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl that Gus dreams about . Why didn't they just market it for what it was ? Thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing , it is actually a well-designed narrative . < br / > < br / > Motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies . This was quite an interesting story , and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--Jordan Michael Christopher ( who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note ) - - and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot . Hopefully its re-release on DVD will make it an easier find for cult fans .
Pilot Mitch MacAfee ( Jeff Morrow ) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar . Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase . It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing . But what is it and why is it here ? < br / > < br / > This has all the right elements for a classic . It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored . The acting is good ( for a 1950s monster movie ) . Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest . She's also strong and takes care of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie . The problem here is the monster . Dear God--it's TERRIBLE ! It looks like a deranged turkey ! It has a long neck , a hilariously stupid BEAK , some teeth , a few strands of hair on its head and claws . And--oh yes--it squawks ! Not roaring--squawking ! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production . Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre . Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended ! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this . He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever . And you can SEE the wires moving it too ! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done . It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train ! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever .
Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation , but Adam Low ( the director of this thing ) allows the stronger voice to be Helmut Berger's ! How can it be ? What a missed opportunity ! We come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the Master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all . The beautiful images belong to Visconti's world , the embarrassing interviews to the likes of Berger and Zeffirelli to Adam Low's tiny little world . A must to avoid !
" Murder Over New York " is fun , but not as good as most of the other Fox Chans . This film would have been better named , " Charlie Chan in New York " , the film's working title . This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple . There is a lot to like here , though , including guest star Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges . < br / > < br / > This has one of my favorite Chan sayings , " Coincidence like ancient egg--leave unpleasant odour . " Toler and Yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast . But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which I look for in these films . Still , it is good to see .
Having been born and raised in Odessa , and having graduated from the " other " high school in the late 70 ' s , Odessa High School , I had mixed emotions about this movie . I no longer live in Odessa , but will always be a Texan at heart . I didn't like the way that this town of 80,000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town . If I'm wrong about this , please feel free to correct me , but I believe OHS also plays in the town stadium , and the " Home of the Permian Panthers " sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at Permian . I would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year , OHS vs Permian . I am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though , I think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed . Overall , the movie was okay , made me a little homesick , remembering the " good old days " of MOJO .
Hey there Army Sgt . I'm sorry dude but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie . You are not a Marine and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a Marine . We simply are the best , we have the hardest training , yes we have big heads about ourselves , but hey when you are the best , you like to strut your stuff . I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah . I fought next to soldiers . You are not " qualified " to say anything about my Marine Corps . I hate to be the one that starts the whole " which branch is better " , but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a Marine movie . Oh yeah ... we are Drill Instructors ... not Drill SGT's . That's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about . Yeah we do not " curse " at recruits anymore . Tell me , how is cussing at someone going to make them a better Marine ? How will me hitting someone make a Marine a better Marine ? Yes it is a kinder boot camp from what I went through . But we are dealing with different times and people . We are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits . We want smarter recruits , not meaner . And anyone who signs up to be a Marine in the first place , has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer . We don't have to reinforce that in Bootcamp . Marines come to Bootcamp wanting to be killers . We don't need to teach them that by demoralizing them by swearing at them and beating them . At least that is how I feel.And yes , I am " qualified " to say that . I have been on the battlefield numerous times and I have trained Marines and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield . But then again , what do I know . I was just there , done that , got the t-shirt . SGT of the Army ... get a clue !
I'd chose either over this film . This film has been in my " must see " list for a while because people talked about it being " disturbing " and also the VHS box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how " amazing " it is , or how " as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre " and lines like that . But , sorry folks , I was disappointed big time . The idea is interesting , but the script is SO underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film . < br / > < br / > That , in turn , takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had . I couldn't believe how unnecessarily looong some " where is he , let's find him " sequences were . A few gory moments to please the gore fan , but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point . If Luther's a geek , then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain .
It was only the second year of the Academy but already they were voting politically - Jeanne Eagels ' brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an Oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win - Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE . The only existing print was a work print without music or final editing , but wherever it's shown , Eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling , powerful performance . She is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth ( we did after all SEE her kill the man ) , we in the audience find ourselves , like the jurors , believing in her innocence , before we suddenly catch ourselves . THAT is GREAT ACTING . The film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again . ( One silent of Jeanne's exists in archive print - MAN , WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie , JEALOUSY , is " lost , " so this is the only document we have of her . Run to see it ( when it first came out of the archives to be shown in NYC in the early 70s , the Village Voice printed a full page review , worshipping the Eagels performance ) .
This was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever ! It refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get . This movie had one of the most ' human ' ( And I use this term in a good way ) compassionate religious character ever ! This movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book ( Which is rare for me ) . Sister Helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious ( Which is also rare ) . And it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out . And we have the director to thank for that . This is not a film for entertainment . But it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart . I can't think of another film like it .
The film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere--and has , in substance if not form . Those concerned about 1st amendment issues , censorship , et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate , dramatize , teach , inspire . < br / > < br / > Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor ; he shines in this film , showing off multiple acting talents that you must see ( I have yet to see him give a bad performance , though , even in not-so-great films ) . Stowe gives perhaps her best performance ( and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in Hollywood ) - - in two words : stunning , convincing . < br / > < br / > The set design perfectly matches the situation , in function and mood . The sound editing heightens to appropriate effect . The total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device-and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story's necessary venue . The script is tight and essential , with engagingly dramatic-yet realistic-dialogue ( i . e . , as it might be and ought to be ) . Perhaps the most amazing aspect to contend with is the fact that 1 ) this is the director's first time out ; and 2 ) he is the writer . In one phrase : a tour de force--with three recommendations : see it , own a copy , see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius .
I go to blockbuster , pick out a random movie , got this , and yeah . < br / > < br / > This ... was a good sexual porno .. the quality kind of sucked , and it kind of gave me a damn headache . To me , this movie was good for its sexual things , but not as much for the horror and suspense . It was ... magical ... < br / > < br / > The suspense .. not as good as I would have expected . I wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear , but instead I lay down on the couch and didn't see much . < br / > < br / > The quality .. not really good at all . I mean , if you pay close attention , during when the people are on the COLD mountains , their barely wearing anything . It doesn't make much sense too . < br / > < br / > So if your looking for a crap , not really suspenseful , and a pretty much sexual movie , you've got this .
I saw a great clip of this film , which I'll talk about later , and then the cast list , and thought I might as well give it a go . Basically , a down-on-his-luck bartender , Randy ( Matt Dillon ) , his cocky cousin Carl Harding ( Paul Reiser ) and murder investigation Detective Dehling ( John Goodman ) all have something in common , they have seen the girl of their dreams ( whether married or not ) , and they would do anything to please and be with her , even die . All three met / saw her " one night at McCool's " , the bar that Randy worked at , they have no knowledge of each other , but all three cannot stop thinking of Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine ( The Lord of the Rings ' Liv Tyler ) . All three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories , Randy talks to hit-man Mr . Burmeister ( Michael Douglas , who co-produced the film ) , Carl to psychologist / psychiatrist Dr . Green ( Reba McEntire ) and Dehling to priest Father Jimmy ( Richard Jenkins ) . They confess all details of what they have been willing to do , their sexual contact with her , and eventually they are all brought together in one place , all intent on being with her , and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead , one running away ( and eventually dying ) and one stunned , and the unexpected guy she chooses ( but at the same time obvious , cos it's sex-obsessed Douglas ) . Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman . If I had to pick a favourite moment , it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments , where Tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself , and in front of Goodman , very sexy ! Apart from that , not the most memorable film . Okay !
Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their faces . A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera . By the time he returns ( still no senior cops , SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn't it ? ? ) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence , only after she'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene . < br / > < br / > I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images ! ! The horror continues : - not in the film itself ( pretty ordinary I'm afraid ) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington . This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who , instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners , entrusts the work to an untrained cop , a rookie cop , who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible . Now that was a bright idea eh ? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable . < br / > < br / > I have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended !
A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her evasive fiancé . This is a much-maligned film because of its denouement , but up to that point , it's interesting , well-acted , eerie , and with fine set design ( by William Cameron Menzies , developed for 3 - D projection ) . Veronica Hurst is captivating and genteel , sort of a chic British Marilyn Monroe , still in love with Richard Carlson , who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle ; there are even bats in the belfry ! It moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece , when Hurst and her aunt ( Katherine Emery , also the narrator ) , sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center . As a kid , I always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier ( or claustrophobic ) than not finding your way out of a 10 - foot high maze of hedges . Naturally , the two women get separated , setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music . The final result is mildly disappointing really , since Carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on , even provoking sympathy . Worth seeing .
This was not a good movie ! ! Why do you people keep saying that ? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires ! ! ! Why ? Why are there vampires ? Where did they come from ? Also , what the hell ? ! There are all of these " super human " vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them . Quickly too . It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle . There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies ! The next thing you know , Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of Mexico . End of story . Literally . Oh and the strip club was an Aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern Mexico not the border . Why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie ? Do not rent , buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house . You will wish you had that time of your life back .
Just a great soundtrack . Really enjoyable music . Outstanding cast , great lead performance . Worth watching . < br / > < br / > Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood . You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated . < br / > < br / > This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted . I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright . < br / > < br / > The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively , engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music , food , drink , dancing , gambling and sex .
I found ' Shuttle ' an incredibly frustrating film to watch . It starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first ' injury ' ( which is a doozy ) . After that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story . It was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot . If you hate film where you can't understand why characters do what they do , you will loathe ' Shuttle ' . Particularly , the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense . Also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend , rather than generating sympathy from the audience , most people started to giggle . This was probably because the ' heroines ' of the story was a complete idiots . Finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be ' shocking ' and comes from the horror cop-out school of ' people are bad , audience , so just accept it without any explanation ' . < br / > < br / > ' Shuttle ' is neither good or bad , but mediocre . And annoying .
This is one cheap looking movie ! A stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her . She goes to the police who also rape her . She finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to ' The Zombie Master ' . The fact that Stephanie Beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film .
I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment I considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead . I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder , so I can't complain about the price , but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded . The acting was mediocre , and the special effects were deplorable . People shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the prehistoric creatures look as good or better than those in Jurassic Park . Spielberg spoiled us . Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the movie's only saving grace . I noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest , and the only explanation is that they ogled over Burns the whole time . The whole long 103 minutes . This movie should have been over in about 80 minutes . It just dragged on and on and on . Don't waste your time or your money on this far-fetched flick .
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley ( Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock ) , her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera . In a state of complete denial and delusion , Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied , small town life to search for " Dr . David Ravell " ( Greg Kinnear ) , the handsome and loving hero of " A Reason to Love " , a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles . Immune to reality , Betty arrives in L . A . and becomes " Nurse Betty " as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover . Meanwhile , the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down , convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del . < br / > < br / > Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her . By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life , Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality . Thus , while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film , Nurse Betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities . In addition , Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state , particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between " Dr . David Ravell " , the character , and George McCord ( Greg Kinnear ) , the actor who plays him . Betty's incapacity to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings , which stress the magnitude of her delusional state . However , in spite of these successes , Nurse Betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves . For example , while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair , the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced . Similarly , although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man , the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty . < br / > < br / > Finally , toward the end of the film , Charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty ; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love , and which ultimately destroys him . Consequently , since the characters ' roles as victims lack consistency , the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial . All in all , Nurse Betty's indeterminacy - - rather than creating suspense - - weakens its characters and pollutes its plot . < br / > < br / >
It's the one film I almost walked out of , and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me . Normally , even if I don't like a film , I think it's still worth sitting through it to the end . That way , you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself . But with The Million Dollar Hotel , it was so dreadful I just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible . I think I probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director , one I didn't normally like so much . But coming from Wenders , it was all the more shocking to behold . I know Bono from U2 , a good friend of Wenders's , wrote the script to this abysmal film , and I wonder why Wenders let him , as buddy-buddy as the two may have been . " Stick to the day job , Bono " , is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess . Pretentious , disjointed , a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype , a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring , with the most irritating characters I have ever set eyes upon , especially the leads , Jeremy Davies , Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson , none of whom I dislike normally . The happiest ending I could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible . On a positive note , the first five minutes of the film are extremely good , with an extremely stirring soundtrack from U2 . But the film's opening shots make the rest of the film ( which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on ) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered , not even close .
Director J . S . Cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy , but nothing more . A widowed mother Karen Tunny ( Lori Heuring ) inherits a home in the Pennsylvania mountains ; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere . But it is somewhere , somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank . The area and especially the Tunny estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls . The legend is the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge ; and you better believe it . Also in the cast : Ben Cross , Scout Taylor-Compton , Chloe Moretz , Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis .
I know what you're saying , " Oh man , Pinochio is not scary ! " but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio . Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll Pinnochio who seems to talk to her . The only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her . In the end is shocking revelation that , as did I , will shock you . Watch it . Give it a try .
As a flying and war movie buff , this ranks at he bottom of my list . It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high-school play . The acting , script , direction , production standards and casting are all garbage . The only saving grace is some of the flying sequences . If the people they portray were fictitious , I might rate it a 2 , but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies , it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be , actually did this ! Its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable WW1 personalities as possible.There are many good WW1 flying films and this is NOT one of them .
there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda , that story told about young writer who is seekin ' his place after a second war ( he's survive german camp ) . excellent true atmosphere ( action goes in camp for displaced placed ) , main hero ( played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski ) finally fall in love , but unfortunately his lady has been killed . there was beautiful scene , when he is talking with american soldier and says ( about death his girl ) " nothing is happen , simply you're shootin ' to us now ... he's condition of soul has been destroyed . 10/10
Blade is a dark , gloomy , but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones . A bit of gore , but nothing really that bad . Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires . Not really like buffy , because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night ... thats at best viewing ! < br / > < br / > 87 %
Playwright John Osborne's ( Look Back in Anger , The Entertainer ) dramatisation of Oscar Wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original , perhaps too much so . Nonetheless , the dialogue , the acting , with a cast headed by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett , and the brilliantly cerebral production ( marred only by a " too quick " ending ) make this worth the while of any lover of Theater , with a capital " T " .
As a movie , THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best ; good ( not great ) acting , < br / > < br / > nice visuals and pacing , a mediocre plot , but nothing bad enough < br / > < br / > to walk out on . But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINI < br / > < br / > Coopers , this film is spectacular ! < br / > < br / > * SPOILERS * < br / > < br / > Ok , it's a typical heist film with the odd twist ( the underwater safe - cracking was nice , if not improbable ) , and the cast was fairly solid < br / > < br / > ( with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg ) , but when it all came < br / > < br / > down to it , the real " stars " of this picture were the three MINI < br / > < br / > Coopers , in all their high-flying , speed-racing , ramp-jumping , < br / > < br / > bullet-taking , gold-lugging , shiny new glory . The audience I was < br / > < br / > sitting amongst actually " ooed " and " aahed " when Theron's little < br / > < br / > red number first hit the screen ( strangely enough , neither she nor < br / > < br / > Wahlberg garnered the same reaction ) . < br / > < br / > The film starts out promising . Mos Def , Seth Green , Donald < br / > < br / > Sutherland , Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as an < br / > < br / > interesting and humourous band of characters , with the only real < br / > < br / > uninspired performance being that of the usually good Mark < br / > < br / > Wahlberg . Why he claims this is his best film I can't imagine ; his < br / > < br / > character is completely one-note , and he plays him so blandly it < br / > < br / > was as if Mr . Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting < br / > < br / > his body . Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter , though < br / > < br / > nothing magical . Seth Green's character is perfect and the < br / > < br / > running Napster jokes ( including a cameo by Napster founder , < br / > < br / > Shawn Fanning ) are hilarious ; he and some of Mos Def's early < br / > < br / > lines add some much needed sparks of humour . Unfortunately , < br / > < br / > Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get near enough < br / > < br / > screen time . < br / > < br / > You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away , and the < br / > < br / > dialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways , but I doubt the < br / > < br / > filmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here , so taken as a < br / > < br / > typical action / suspense flick it comes out alright . Worth seeing on < br / > < br / > cheap night I'd recommend . < br / > < br / > 7/10 . Not worth it's weight in gold , but makes for nice fillings .
There are many reasons I'm not a fan of fact based films , but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story . If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original ? Otherwise stick to the facts . This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that . Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being . It's been said if you were to take Michael Myers , Jason Voorhees and Leatherface , wrap them into one person , Ed Gein would still be sicker / scarier . So why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this ? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction ? < br / > < br / > I've read books and watched news programs about him and , now I'm not a screenwriter or anything , but I believe there's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented . I'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his Mother , and girlfriend as filler , and far too much of it . < br / > < br / > I guess what I'm wondering is this ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein ? Why didn't we get to know his Mother , Father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath he was ... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became ? Instead , the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy ... running . < br / > < br / > In the end I give it 4/10 stars . Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder . Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion , considering Gein was a smallish man , and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine . Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees .
This was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end . Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much . It could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the American Pie series higher ratings . < br / > < br / > Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst , not an agent , who is to observe an interrogation of an Egyptian man by Moroccans , not Egyptians . He's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used . This is more believable than if he were to come across as being an " old hat " at it . < br / > < br / > The story jumps around a bit and can be confusing , but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place . The supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie . I found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking .
Well as a life long fan of Kung Fu films I have to say this is one of the best I have ever seen . Sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain . As does most movies of the genre . This film is packed with action and does not boar its viewers . It's so damn fun when I watch I have a smile on my face the whole time . This also has an impact on future films like Kill Bill . ( Many of Kill Bill's Sound effects come from this film for example . ) This is essential viewing for all knew viewers in Kung Fu . Form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better I have seen in the genre . There are few Kung Fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film . So if in search of a Great Kung Fu movie check this one out for sure .
I had looked forward to viewing this movie , it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it . I was completely disappointed . The acting was so overdone . The script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script . < br / > < br / > Spoilers : Was any cliche omitted in this movie ? There was a mobstyle hit , homosexuality , prostitution , a serial killer , a fire , numerous godfather wannabees , the main character in love with the prostitute , cross dressing , torture by the police , Hannibal Lechter style mutilations , I could go on and on . < br / > < br / > Line's like ( the godfather wannabe to the prostitute ) < br / > < br / > - " Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum " ( I don't want u to work anymore ) < br / > < br / > - " Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek ? " ( Who would pay the rent if I didn't work ) < br / > < br / > Unrealistic scenes : We never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes , yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks . < br / > < br / > The only way I can make sense out of this whole movie , is if the version I had scene was severely edited from the original . I definitely do not recommend it , and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so . < br / > < br / >
This is by far my favorite action movie . But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups . It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L . Jackson . < br / > < br / > The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel . Thank God it was never made . Too much danger of marring the original . < br / > < br / > ' The Long Kiss ' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again . Never a dull moment . < br / > < br / > This has to be Jackson's funniest role ever , and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career . No quirky Tarantino hit-man , super-cool Shaft , or borderline psycho soldier . In TLKG , Jackson is the everyman we identify with . The poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past . < br / > < br / > Though the story claims that Davis's character , Samantha Caine is suffering from amnesia , the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder . < br / > < br / > Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore - - she is a separate , fully-developed personality . The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of Charly to emerge again . < br / > < br / > The materials of her past life excavated by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charly's resurfacing . Good timing , too , considering the target Samantha makes of herself . < br / > < br / > But Charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality . One gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality ( Charly ) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the " Chapter " . < br / > < br / > In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche , though , her Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality . ( She's even funnier that Charly . ) This was probably due to becoming a mother , because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly's struggle to suppress Samantha , leading to their apparent integration by movie's end . < br / > < br / > It's impossible to choose a " best quote " from this film : < br / > < br / > " Now you're a sharpshooter ? " < br / > < br / > " I saved your ass . It was great ! " < br / > < br / > " Continue dying . Out . " < br / > < br / > " I sock ' em in the jaw and yell ' Pop goes the weasel ' " . < br / > < br / > And a couple of dozen more , many too raunchy to quote here . < br / > < br / > Geena Davis looks great , and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she's turning forty . ( Listen to Charley's history , do the math ) . < br / > < br / > Fantastic soundtrack , too . Santana , Muddy Waters , Elvis , LaBelle , Marvin Gaye . < br / > < br / > I give ' The Long Kiss Goodnight ' a 9 , only because I don't believe in a perfect 10 . Seen it a dozen times , and it still stays fresh . Nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to ' It's A Wonderful Life . '
Some sort of accolades must be given to ` Hellraiser : Bloodline ' . It's actually out Full-Mooned Full Moon . It bears all the marks of , say , your ` Demonic Toys ' or ` Puppet Master ' series , without their dopey , uh , charm ? Full Moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly . These Hellraiser things , man , do they ever take themselves seriously . This increasingly stupid franchise ( though not nearly as stupid as I am for having watched it ) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish . Now it's just ish .
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means ? Does our society teach this ? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others ? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment ? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment ? How is a " typical " human alike or different than Rose ? Lastly , would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy ? I loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me , while it entertained , stimulated , and kept me guessing to the end ! Every time I've watched it , I have learned more about the film and myself .
A sadly inferior precursor to " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf " this film drags on and on , occasionally reviving your interest only to put you through more selfindulgent maundering and obvious but patently overdone plot points . < br / > < br / > It may list as 111 minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time .
Some people may call " Cooley High " the same sort of thing as " American Graffiti " , but I wouldn't . For starters , in " AG " , everyone was white , whereas in " CH " they're all black . Moreover , this one has a Motown soundtrack . Specifically , the movie focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics . The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships . In their apartments , we see that there's never any dad around . But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest . < br / > < br / > One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible , worrying about missing school . Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene , and the one white guy in the movie . But overall , the main star is the soundtrack . It is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history ( we even have it on vinyl here at home ) . A classic in the real sense of the word .
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines , mindless plot , and the kind of nauseous acting that made " The Postman " one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time . But I was shocked . Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience . Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role . Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions . Not since ' Robin Hood ' have I seen this Costner : full of depth and complex emotion . Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in " Butterfly Effect " . These two actors came into this film with a serious , focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year . No , its not an Oscar worthy movie . It's not an epic , or a profound social commentary film . Rather , its a story about a simple topic , illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible . That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work . Bravo !
First off , this film has no story . It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production - - sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible , and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set . < br / > < br / > That said , the film is kinda brilliant . Pfeiffer is amazing - - and I mean amazing , as Catwoman ; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good / bad tendencies . Walken is Walken - - but even more nasty than usual . Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin , but he is good and memorable . < br / > < br / > Keaton is underrated as Batman . < br / > < br / > And the music and style are pure cinema thrill . True , the 3rd act doesn't work . But the final 2 scenes are knockouts , and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness . That's too bad , because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry , and had they acted in a third installment , Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans .
Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over . Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes  a small park ; and empty tennis court ; a piano . Now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow , semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you . Great  you've just imagined the entirety of the film ` India Song . ' < br / > < br / > The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out ` Look at me ! I am PROFOUND ! ! ' with such blatant self-importance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity , but COMICALLY bereft of profundity . The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above , since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen , and even when they are , the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture . They never speak or interact in any meaningful way  they just stand there looking at each other , and occasionally crying . The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion . In fact , the visuals could easily have been left out entirely , as the story is told completely through narration . The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot , and hates people don't hate India because it's hot ( this point is covered several times ) . It is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman , since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to , but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks , and he's very upset about this . So he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek . Later on , he stares at his bicycle , as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek . Actually , you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle , but you know it's there anyway , just because that's the sort of film this is . < br / > < br / > At best , the narration becomes background hum , serving as a perfect compliment to the coma-inducing visuals . Simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination . To watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark . This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that man will ever know .
This movie is not worth a descend review , it just made me decide that I am not going to go see the next Tarantino film . And I used to love Tarantino's films . < br / > < br / > Not artsy , not entertaining , not witty , not funny , nothing , just dull and stupid . If this movie would have been Tarantinos first , it would have also been his last . < br / > < br / > Tarantino has to get a grip on himself , otherwise his next movie is going to be 3 hours of meaningless , boring and uncool dialog . It seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog - and his love is blind . < br / > < br / > After you finish your popcorn's there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore .
* minor spoilers * < br / > < br / > You know , it's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might just as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation . These sequels range from excellent ( " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " and the fantastic " Lion King II : Simba's Pride " ) to horrible ( " The Return of Jafar " ) . ( This is , of course , my personal opinion . ) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel . " Scamp's adventure , " and while it is flawed , it is still entertaining . < br / > < br / > The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation ; still , the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life . Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955 . Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and " Ol ' Reliable , " and Jock still gives him grief about it . There's a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound , and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads ( though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor . ) < br / > < br / > I really don't care for most of the songs ( though Roger Bart and Susan Egan--the singing voices of Scamp and Angel--sing their parts very nicely ) . Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past . Danny Troob's score is okay , but nothing memorable . And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage ; that is , they really don't do much . < br / > < br / > The voice work , on the other hand , is quite good . While I don't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher , he is very good as Tramp . Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster , leader of the junkyard gang , and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel . Then there is Scamp ( who is the spitting image of his dad ) . He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf . Wolf does a superb job of showing Scamp's wild streak and his soft side . < br / > < br / > All in all , while " Scamp's Adventure " is flawed , it still makes for rather entertaining viewing . It is my hope , however , that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases . < br / > < br / >
This is the worst movie I have ever seen . A movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth . < br / > < br / > SPOILERS IF YOU EVEN CARE < br / > < br / > They can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie . The movie ends and they're like , " Well , some day we'll have to kill it . " < br / > < br / > Avoid at all costs .
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite , which I try to catch on TV every year if I can . It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane , charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck . However , in contrast to Martha , this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever . The other cast members effectively complete the story , and include Dennis Morgan ( Jefferson Jones ) , Reginald Gardiner ( John Sloan ) , and Sydney Greenstreet ( Alexander Yardley ) . < br / > < br / > Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles , portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children . In reality , she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg . Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend , Felix . Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine , Alexander Yardley , decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas , and invites himself to visit her , bringing with him a returning war hero , Jefferson Jones , a sailor who had been shipwrecked . Yardley demands total honesty of his employees . To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career , Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor , John Sloan , a dull , fussy chap who has long sought marriage . She also borrows a neighbour's baby ( actually , several ) to pass off as her own and her ' husband ' Sloan's . < br / > < br / > Of course this scenario makes for much merriment . It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance , with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere . Whenever I think of this movie , I picture the snowflakes falling , the tree beautifully decorated , the fire roaring in the hearth , the turkey roasting , and Christmas cookies baking . < br / > < br / > Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake ? I understand there is a 1992 version , directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon , Kris Kristofferson , and Tony Curtis . I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to . This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday ' must see ' along with It's a Wonderful Life , White Christmas , Miracle on 34th Street , and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol .
Pat O'Brien portrays Knute Rockne , the All-American Notre Dame football coach . No doubt , this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of " Knute Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football " - probably , it's most interesting to serious followers of football and / or Notre Dame football . You will see some good documentary-style film footage . < br / > < br / > Otherwise , it's difficult to recommend this as a FILM . It's not much more than an historical document . You'll " know " the end is near when Gale Page gets a chill - and , don't blink or you'll miss Ronald Reagan doing , of all things , " Camille " ! < br / > < br / > * * * Knute Rockne - All-American ( 1940 ) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien , Gale Page , Ronald Reagan
Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty . She teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners ( Candis Cayne ) and get her kidnapped niece back ... or something like that . Seriously - - I had trouble concentrating on the plot ! The movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe ADD--quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything . The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible ! The acting is actually pretty OK except for Ru Paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree . Also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny . After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored , sick and just couldn't stand it anymore . I pride myself on sitting through anything but this went WAY beyond my limits ! People are comparing this to the early work of John Waters . I disagree . Waters ' work is sick but good--this is just sick . Avoid .
This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is . It is a movie both for children and parents , and it is " timeless " . I saw this movie before Ocean's Eleven and must admit that the actors in OE has class in advance , but the play of Klatretøsen is much more down-to-earth and moving . Why i say Ocean's Eleven , is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and Klatretøsen is THAT good ! that it can bear comparison with OE . The 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe , compared to what we are used to in Denmark . The different cases of impossible acts , is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors ( and sometimes not even from the " old boys " ) . The story ? again it has things in common with Ocean's Eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in Klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom . The part in which the young people has to take care of Ida's younger brother , gives a fine element in the movie . Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy , on your arm :-) . < br / > < br / > This movie can bear comparison with most " grown up " movie like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven . Yes i do believe it is THAT good . It is best to see it in a theater , as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-) . < br / > < br / > Regards Klavs .
This is an amazingly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play . Its major drawback is a static camera , and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is , which is a pity , for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking , made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems , and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention . Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films , and her entrance is still classic . Her voice is strangely deep , almost boyish , which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona . As her boyfriend , Charles Bickford is appropriately virile , - - he was apparently born craggy--and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo . His Irish brogue is not bad at all , and he seems always a natural man of the sea , very O'Neill-like in his independent , brooding nature . As Garbo's ( very ) confused father , George Marion seems truly from another time . He has the sort of face and voice , - - open , unmannered , totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth . Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things . Her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes , as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis . Poetic license , perhaps , as this is not in the script , but we can forgive Miss Dressler's excesses ; she is too good at it not to . The story ends with a movement to the next thing , as distinct from resolution , which isn't the author's cup of tea ; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise . In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country , a place of sea , storms and fog , a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty , which we would now call ambivilance , or anxiety neurosis . Rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it , as weather , land , ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard .
Okay wait let me get this street , there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel . I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original . Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life . Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle . Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish , two was crap , three was stupid , four is alright , five is well five , H20 alright , Resurrection painful . Yet , in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels . Why ? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time . OK where should i start , ah yes the plot oh boy the plot . Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults , signs of Thor and some other crap . It's just stupid it really is , the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet , its heaped together in such a horribly made way . Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people ? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice , but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap . God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did , the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite . Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way , Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two , heck maybe even four . Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody ? I thought it was meant to be the other way round , yet Myers is so similar to Jason , all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways . In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful . In this he just walks around hacking people to death . I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous . Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head , i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight . What else is crap , oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad , in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course . I can't stand the little kid , i wish he had got it he's really irritating . Our Heroin is boring and not interesting . And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors . The mother is rubbish , the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something ? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers < By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable . What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis , don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act , he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him . I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really . There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account . Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features . Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this . What else is rubbish , oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it . Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house ? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film . Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film .
I actually saw the movie before I read the book . When I saw the movie I was upset because I wondered why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie . The movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all , it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the TV . I couldn't connect with the characters at all , so i didn't care about what happened to them ( normally I love the characters because I can relate to their personality or problems ) . Then I read the book and loved it . I often re-read the book , and the movie is collecting dust . I wish someone would make a Koontz movie that follows the plot of his books , then the movies wouldn't suck so much . DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU NEED TO WASTE MONEY !
I don't watch very many ' horror ' movies , but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins . Now , we're teenagers , so we tend to make fun of a lot of things , but honestly , the acting here really wasn't very good , especially at the beginning . One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany , " This is so ... high school ! " while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it ... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny , badly-written , badly-acted Lizzie McGuire episode . However , as the story progressed , and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time , I was able to appreciate the movie more . Camilla Belle did really well in this movie , and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her . And I must admit , this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen . Well , no , there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls , but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen . And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary ... We all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives , but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen . The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most cliché movies I've ever seen . It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had - turning the keys and the car starts , shadows in the corner , turning the corners of the stairs with suspense , turning around and seeing a dead body , ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream , etc . At the suspenseful scenes , it was very predictable , but overall , I would give it a 7/10 . It's definitely worth seeing . < br / > < br / > By the way , This is my first review , so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers .. But just to be safe ...
Although a made for cable film by HBO , it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back-stabbing and double-dealing world of television . Allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so-called late night talk show wars in the early 90s , as Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the Tonight Show . Kathy Bates gives a bravo performance as Leno's mercurial manager Helen Kushnick and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman endured at the hands of tv executives . It is just as timely now , considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by ABC to replace Nightline with Letterman . No matter how many times I have seen this film , I still find it as much a pleasure to watch as I did when it first aired . If this should ever be released on DVD , I would certainly add it to my collection .
This movie tries to be artistic but comes across as puerile as a film school student's first attempt . Next it tries to be erotic but comes across as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt . Lastly it tries to be cruel & gripping , but aside from Kinski's performance--which is powerful but conspicuously misplaced amidst the amateur melodrama--it's about as gripping as your hand around a wet noodle ( which is an appropriate metaphor considering how un-erotic this film is ) . It features a blowjob scene which is even lamer than Chloë Sevigny's career-burying performance in The Brown Bunny . Run away now while you have the chance . Go find yourself a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalogue instead--it's more artistic AND more erotic than this tripe .
This film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster . As I recall ( and it's a few years since I've seen the film ) the action starts with a London omnibus filled with people . There is an horrific crash and one passenger dies . The rest of the film is then told in flashback , with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail . At the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy , vivid characters has met a gruesome end . Great stuff , a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise , even handed detail . If only it were available on video ...
The decline series is amazing and director PS can't get enough credit for making these movies . I'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one , or the other two , but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans-formative years between the late seventies and early eighties . The film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band X . Many interviews with bands and punker's that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder . No internet , crappy jobs , and all out hostility collide in this genre . For new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock . All the band performances ( and there are many ) are awesome , especially FEAR who never cease to amaze me . This and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people . It's true punk , like in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out , they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the EMT's had a chuckle on this one , and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house , the response " no i hate painters " . How about Black Flag renting their apartment / rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month ! My jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400 . Between watching this and Deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period , just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way . The people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is , and they did it in their own unique way . Brilliant film , ten stars , see part 2 as well its equally awesome , part 3 though , i don't know what to say about .
These are the kinds of movies I loved , and still love growing up . Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them . This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy . < br / > < br / > There was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't A list material . But that is not the point . The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché ' filled movies . There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you , and not get as much money as they can . < br / > < br / > Besides , its also nice to know that good ol ' Bruce isn't dead yet .
This is a decent movie . Although little bit short in time for me , it packs a lot of action , grit , commonsense and emotions in that time frame . Matt Dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie . The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie . It is not typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie , but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price . My evening was great because of this movie . This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting , story and directing . I would recommend this movie . The character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place . Because this movie I believe was made with cheaper budget , the acting and quality were much higher .
There's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time . < br / > < br / > I've seen " Pumping Iron II " , " Aces : Iron Eagle III " , " Raven Hawk " , and even the TV movie " Getting Physical " , which featured some big names in the sport . They were tolerable in their own ways ( mostly , because they featured Rachel McLish . ROWWR ! ! ) . < br / > < br / > Then I went and watched " Nemesis III : Prey Harder " , on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as Sue Price , Debbie Muggli , Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev . Love the ladies , always will , but after this I'm kinda glad I missed the first two " Nemesis " flicks . < br / > < br / > Well , the first one , anyway . Most of the footage here is lifted bodily ( and kicking and screaming , I would guess ) from " Nemesis II " . Actually , that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here . < br / > < br / > But even though Price and company flex and pose , they don't get much of a chance to do anything else ( like , say , ACT ! ) . In fact , this whole film is an exercise ( Get it ? Ha-ha ... ) in oblique story-telling , ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making ( in terms of filming as well as the story-line ) . < br / > < br / > Nothing makes much sense but even if it did , there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these . What a crime . < br / > < br / > Of course , it was written and directed by Albert Pyun , so what did you expect : cohesion ? < br / > < br / > One star only , in consideration for all the hard work that Price , Muggli , Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put into their bodies , NOT the " craft " work done within the movie itself . < br / > < br / > Thanks , ladies .
Where do I begin ? I first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect , I was actually at the time searching out films that Elijah Wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended . I sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think . I watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened . Never before in my life had I ever really cried while watching a film , and I was blubbing , every high and low the film I was riding right alongside , on an emotional roller coaster . < br / > < br / > It struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels , the intense sadness and elation we see in the film , the wonder and innocence of childhood , the yearning for a time that once was , but is no more . More than anything , this film reminded me of my childhood ( except for the abuse ) during a time in my life when I'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed , I'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it . The Radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what I'd given up without really even noticing . From that day forward I immediately set about to change my life and myself , and I did . < br / > < br / > This is going to sound corny but basically I rediscovered my inner child , I started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much , so much for the better , embracing and living that part of myself . I've been finding out who I really am . I don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life , The Radio Flyer really did something very special , and I still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects , an incredible film . < br / > < br / > In closing I cannot fail to mention the music . I am a great fan of Hans Zimmer and this is among his very finest works . The sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me . Like subtitles to a foreign language film , his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through . Find the soundtrack at all costs , it was sadly deleted long ago , I never expected to find it but amazingly did , after chatting with someone I met on a Hans Zimmer fansite guest book . < br / > < br / > Watch this film , let yourself live the emotions , don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending , be that child again
Not for everyone , but I really like it . Nice ensemble cast , with nice contributions from better known players ( like Stockard Channing ) and strong eye candy ( from Sheila Kelley ) . What really works is the bond between the three brothers ! Try it , you'll smile a little .
I recommend Idiocracy to everyone . Luke Wilson is very funny , the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard I had tears running down my face several times . Until the end , when I took a breath and realized just how close we are to Mr . Judge's vision of tomorrow . < br / > < br / > Keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the Mac commercials ( Justin Long ) as Dr . Lexus . I found his performance Oscar-worthy , especially considering what Oscars have been handed out for in the recent past ... besides , he's cute . < br / > < br / > In short , Idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names ( the president's middle name is Mountain Dew ) , hospital visits cost $ 5 billion dollars , there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all , and nobody cares about anything but money . All because only stupid people are breeding . Sounds familiar to me , somehow . Oh , yeah ; it's what I think of when I see professional wrestling ... < br / > < br / > Seriously , watch this movie . It's a good laugh and it will make you think .
" Mr . Bug Goes To Town " was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced . The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film . < br / > < br / > The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael ( with assistance by Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good , but not as much as the scoring of the picture by Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White for Disney . Harline's " atmospheric music " is superb , and a treat for the ears . < br / > < br / > The layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time , and once again the Fleischer's background artists outdid themselves . The techincolored beauty of the film cannot be denied , and while Hoppity the grasshopper is the star , the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the picture . Swat's voicing by Jack Mercer ( of Popeye fame ) is priceless . Kenny Gardner ( brother-in-law ) of Guy Lombardo ... and a featured vocalist in his band ... does his usual pleasant job in the role of Dick Dickinsen . < br / > < br / > The movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons . The Fleischer Studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product . The movie is tuneful , the story great for all ages , and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present . < br / > < br / > Do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film . Also don't fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3 - D sterioptical process which took four months to construct and employed 16,000 tiny panes of glass in the " electrified " buildings of Manhattan . < br / > < br / > Do not miss Mr . Bug Goes To Town ... aka Hoppity Goes To Town . I'll wager you'll be bug eyed at the results !
Goldrush : A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages . The movie focuses around " Fizzy " ( Alyssa Milano ) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska . The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison ( Bruce Campbell ) . What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget . This tv film was just great . The acting is # 1 ( especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano ) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush . I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation . It is also based on a true story . < br / > < br / > 10/10
For a kid's movie , this is great . As an adult and mother , I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter . There is a lot going on in this movie . The following * might * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie . She also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger . I loved the sense of teamwork you get from watching Barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle . There's nothing in the movie I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers . In fact , I felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done . < br / > < br / > The animation was pretty good . I really enjoy the ice-skating scenes and think that they were very well done . There's a lot of action in this film , so I suspect that most kids would enjoy it ... not just the ones that are really into Barbie . My daughter actually picked it out because of the Pegasus . She loves horses . But she enjoyed the movie very much . My daughter is autistic , and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it . She really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved . < br / > < br / > One thing that I was thinking about was that many people object to Barbie ( and Ken ) because they are so beautiful . Yet , I think that kids , just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things . It's natural . As adults , we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too . It's wonderful though , that the Barbie character and her " boyfriend " have a lot of personality . While it's fun to watch pretty people , it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face . < br / > < br / > Overall , I'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it , too . :)
To quote Clark Griswold ( in the original Christmas Vacation ): " WORSE ? How could things get any worse ? Take a look around here , Ellen . We're at the threshold of hell . " Little did Chevy Chase know that he was describing the " sequel " to one of his best films . Christmas Vacation II sets a new high ( or maybe it should be LOW ) in bad movies . My wife bought this DVD thinking it would actually be a sequel to the original , but we were severely disappointed . This film is LAME . It bears no resemblance to the original , is an absolute waste of film , and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it . It must have set a record on IMDb for the most bad reviews . I really think we have a good case to win a class action lawsuit to recover the money we consumers wasted on this movie .
This is a great little movie , full of interesting characters and situations . While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time , it is still extremely watchable and memorable . The scene where Zachary Scott , sitting on a bus , casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him , is terrific . It defines his character beautifully - - a guy who's so low , he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran , to use as a prop in his various charades . He lies easily as the situation calls for , and captivates the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile . < br / > < br / > I couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce . Scott and Bruce Bennett were teamed again , and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford , with her facial bone structure and large eyes . Also , the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the odious Veda in Mildred Pierce . < br / > < br / > I agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat , with the convenient tumble over a cliff for " Ronnie Mason " , Zachary Scott's character . Also , in one of the final scenes , we see bratty Mona Freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older , smoother Zachary Scott . I think the script should've called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister , instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode . But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie .
In efforts to make a somewhat comedic yet serious movie about the art of growing marijuana , Stephen Gyllenhaal ( director ) fell a few bong rips short of a good movie . While the cast is nothing short of amazing , this movie is extremely hard to sit through . The acting of Billy Bob Thornton , Ryan Phillipe , Jon Bon Jovi , Hank Azaria , and Kelly Lynch couldn't even save this movie from failure . It would be wiser to flush three single dollar bills down the toilet then to check this movie out at the local video store . < br / > < br / >
Halloween 666 ( 1995 ) The producer's cut review ! < br / > < br / > Halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five . If you thought the last chapter was dark , this one will really blow your mind . A mysterious " Man in Black " has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers . In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists . What they want with her ? Who knows , but let's just say her long suffering will end soon . Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents ( good luck ) . A friend of Loomis , Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor . Another old face from part one guest stars as well . < br / > < br / > This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing . For some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time . So they decide to dumb it down . Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office . No matter what they did to the film , they made it worse . They should have left well enough alone . Hey , the film company knows better than the filmmakers now ... don't they ? < br / > < br / > Producer's Cut : Highly recommended < br / > < br / > Released version : Not recommended
... and now I'm up to episode # 7 . I really was hoping it'd be over by now ( not to mention canceled , once everything connected with the show - including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere , never to be seen again ) , because this series really is dire . < br / > < br / > To have this program listed under the genre of ' comedy ' is at best misleading ! It's so hard to believe Ben Elton could write something this bad , maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before . In some episodes I haven't even laughed once ! < br / > < br / > Oh , and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing ' My hero ' & started doing this instead , his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read , and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for ' Blessed ' were . Don't get me wrong , ' My Hero ' is not masterpiece , but it's a million times better than this piece of junk . < br / > < br / > And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well , when there are so many great TV series ' that aren't getting released !
Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up . Must have been too hard on the young stars feet.If the real Marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots . IN the first scenes they took off their leggin's just before starting out on their little trip to find the Farmer . When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes Tony and Skip are wearing combat boots , then later when Lovejoy and Curtis run into the Framer and his daughter Tony is wearing the " Tennis Shoes " but hey have been blacken . The movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest ? ?
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser . Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre , and I think you listen better in theatre ; but on the screen we become more intimate , we're ' up-close ' more than we are in the theatre , we witness subtle changes in expression , we " see " better as well as listen . Both the play and the movie are wondrous : moving , intelligent , illuminating--of the backstage story of the company , of historical context , of the two main characters , and of the parallel characters in " Lear " itself . If you cannot get to see it in a theatre ( I don't imagine it's produced much these days ) then , please , do yourself a favor , and get the video .
There was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful - probably the length of them . Unfortunately this lacks the charm , but it still ends up being a fun film . < br / > < br / > The bright , shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job , there is good plasticene animation used , there is a silly , but well-structured and entertaining plot , an exciting , fun adventure , a good plot idea ( a were-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition ) and good new characters ! < br / > < br / > As well as lacking the original charm , the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour , though good , is slightly overdone , especially compared to the original films . < br / > < br / > The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is drawing near and Wallace and Gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables , now they are Anti Pesto . They are doing a good job , but soon , there is danger afoot . A were-rabbit is nearby ... < br / > < br / > Recommended to all Wallace and Gromit fans and to people who like plasticene films , enjoy " Wallace and Gromit : The Curse of the Wererabbit " ! :-)
It is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in Africa as they are definitely too few . However , the movie depicts Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one ... , I felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership , yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man . There was too little content , explaining how the man got to rise in the first place , and the whole context of Belgium " letting them go " . So it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent , especially Mobutu himself . I would just have liked a better political analysis .
I was born in ' 68 with not much parental guidance as far as what I watched on TV ( as a kid in the 70 ' s ) . I always loved this movie ( and the French Connection ) and would always try to catch it whenever it was on ( checking the Sunday TV guide ahead of time ) . I bought it on DVD a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and I must say , I STILL LOVE IT ! ! ! Roy S . was a great actor from the 70 ' s ( Jaws is one of my all-time favs , Marathon Man etc ) and although the 7 - ups is not an Oscar-worthy film , it puts you precisely in a time a place ( NY , early 70 ' s , as did French Connection ) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time . And yes , the car chase is one of the all-time best .
With all of the " R " movies out today , it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see . My kids loved it . It was good clean fun . I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies .
Ever went on Youtube ? Well , the definite question to that is YES . Do you see the boatloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon rants ? No definite answer . < br / > < br / > Many people think ICarly is a dull and idiotic program , and others think it's the best program on the face of the Earth . I have seen many of the loads of reviews panning ICarly in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses . In my opinion , Icarly is for the kiddies , but the show is just awful . < br / > < br / > If you did not read the last review , here are reasons 1-8 : # 1 : Steryotypes # 2 : Goofed-up drama # 3 : Everything is silly ( taco truck for example ) # 4 : Carly thinks she's nice but she's mean # 5 : Anyone over the drinking age is stupid # 6 : Sam is petite but strong ? # 7 : No real companies # 8: Mean teachers < br / > < br / > # 9 : The webshow overuses 3DFX . Just look on the webshow to understand what I mean . #10 : The webshow also spills personal information . #11 : Almost every famous thing is insulted . Icarly insults the Japanese race , Solitare , Mercades-Benz , and Pac-Man , to name a few . #12 : There are too many reoccuring jokes ( Sam's obsession of meat , Freddy's computer , Gibby pulling his shirt off , etc . ) #13 : The video games based off the show suck . #14 : Freddy has a lack of masculinity . Why ? It's getting unoriginal . #15 : The show is targeted towards a female audience . I also hate shows directed to a male audiences too , so I prefer Icarly to be for both genders . #16 : The words " nub " and " no chiz " . #17 : The overuse of laugh tracks . < br / > < br / > Part 3 coming in early Spring ! Just in time for Spring break !
It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one . I had literally no idea how this film was going to end , because it went left when I expected it to go right , zigged when I expected a zag , etc . This could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller , or depressing white trash drama , but it stayed a course all its own till the end . It is a sad story , though . Not because of what happens to Alice , but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path . < br / > < br / > The plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater , but the pacing could use some tightening up . Either way , it's a very good film , and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low .
Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd . What were they thinking ? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked . Not only that , the " gothic " sequences are tacky , over-the-top , and frankly silly . The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor , and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr . Tilney , he is not a bit like the novel , even when delivering dialog straight out of the book . Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly " ham " performances . This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was .
The story is disjointed and poorly written . We are given threads and a possible hook in act one , only to see it vanish . Had the writer bothered reading his work carefully , it wold have been apparent that Madsden's character's initial problem and meeting with the ' bad ' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem . < br / > < br / > The problem goes nowhere . The relationship goes nowhere . And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships . No-one digs anyone and no-one is appealing . The writing and directing is laughable . You can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement . There is none . The writer / director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie . From simple errors such as ' ... they took polaroids ... ' - in Japan in 2007 ? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism , this movie is an insult . You cannot make them much worse . < br / > < br / > And by plastering ' Madsden ' on the talent list , the producers thought they'd have some success . He is hardly acting . Asia certainly is ... and the result is some heroin-chic panto . < br / > < br / > Give it a big miss .
I missed the beginning of the film . I came in when the partisan's were in the farm house . I can truthfully say that it was horrifying . The moral ramifications are staggering . < br / > < br / > My fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly . I see the Christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot , and I can only pray that I could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example . < br / > < br / > I see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured , but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with . All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that , pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying . Be it mental or physical . < br / > < br / > I found the film very thought provoking .
The first film I saw from these people was " Children of the Grave " and when I heard that this one was coming on I thought it would be good to watch mostly because Waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted . This documentary / film was AWFUL ! There was too much fake commentary from the producers , directors , camera men ... they needed to keep their faces out of this film . Waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary . The paranormal proof was horrible and almost non-existent . I have heard better EVPs from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom ! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary . Not the stories , not the blurry too dark to see anything videos , not the pictures , not the tape recordings ! Children of the Grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor . The only reason I am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative . Learning about how the hospital came about , the daily life there , and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap .
First of all , I have watched this show since I was a little toddler , and I have always loved it . Sure , maybe I didn't understand it when I was that young , but I still enjoyed it ! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years , I love it even more . The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard ! Every note is perfect , I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it ! < br / > < br / > Moving on to this particular production - This is magnificent ! Of course no one could play Mrs . Lovett besides Angela Lansbury , and she does it perfectly . And she should , she has been playing this part for several years . George Hearn is absolutely brilliant . The best Sweeney Todd I have ever heard . He has a wonderful voice , yet he can throw his voice so well ! His " epiphany " is incredible , as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it . The Judge , Toby , Antony , and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles . Everyone is perfect ! Well , I still have to fast forward through Johanna's Green finch and linnet bird . She just doesn't sing that song well at all . < br / > < br / > This show CAN be appreciated at all ages , but it is not always accepted . I am not your typical middle-aged theater lover , I am only 15 years old , yet Sweeney Todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than I have gotten from any other musical .
A boat builder in a sleepy town in Maine is going out of business , and the lives of all of the ( soon to be ex - ) workers and families are disrupted . The biggest disappointment is that the two stars--Bates and Bridges--have only bit parts . < br / > < br / > Interesting , but not something you would see twice . < br / > < br / >
Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new , but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching . Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills , California , in search of a better life . The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family , and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother . < br / > < br / > ( spoilers ) While it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable , Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new . Anywhere But Here doesn't cover any new ground , but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again . Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years , seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance . Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress , as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's very close cousins from back home . His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one , but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this . Not great , but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look .
For a Norris movie this is pretty tame . For an action movie it is kind of dull , and as far as predictability goes my friend and I almost had every turn of this movie nailed . It was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80 ' s action movies , but come on , the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing . Mainly , it is said rather early on that the killer ( Jack O'Halloran , whom is one of the few slightly known actors ) only kills women . YET , he all of a sudden stops his M . O . and kills men , huh ? . I guess it can be construed and rationalized some way , but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women ? ? < br / > < br / > Yet again , I'm sure that there is a reason ( i . e . to build suspense ) , but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior . < br / > < br / > Fans of " Renegade " may enjoy the small cameo by Branscombe Richmond as Victor , but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous . < br / > < br / >
That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film , which happens to be his best ever . He plays Tom Sharky , a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster ( Vittorio Gassman ) and the man he's financing to be the next governor of Georgia ( Earl Holliman ) . In the novel by William Diehl , the story is more complex because the guy's running for president . This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two . The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story . Reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films . He's very serious here , especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong . At times though , the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman . Only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax . Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin , Sharky's Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker , Julie London , Flora Purim & Buddy De Franco , The Manhattan Transfer , Doc Severinson , Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams . Al Capps handles the score with magic . This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever . Check it out . < br / > < br / > Score , 8 out of 10 Stars
This is actually a brilliant movie . The story is grotesque , but the actors are brilliant . Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend , is magnificent . It's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own , but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story , with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken steaks . If only more people understood danish ... This could be a great candidate for an English version . It is also worth mentioning Ole Thestrup , who always delivers that extra twist to the plot , with his slightly mad character Holger . I can only recommend this movie to the danish audience . Also take a look at Adams Æbler ( 2005 ) , a movie by Anders Thomas Jensen , also with Mads Mikkelsen accompanied by a well playing Ulrich Thomsen .
" Boogie Nights " is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director . This film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances . Though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people . This movie has an unexpected emotional impact also , you will remember it long after it is over .
A man is pulled off a London Street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect . Dull , banal film bored the hell out of me . More an idea then a film . I was half way into this 77 minute film when I realized I had no idea who anyone on screen was . It was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character . Certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center , there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough . Its not . And while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it , especially if one has seen the other , better films of a similar ilk ( rendition with Reese Witherspoon for example )
The movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based . It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts , but when I located them , I could see that truth , in this case , was stranger than fiction . Judith Light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie , so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role , the mark I think of an excellent performance . Rick Schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court , an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent , no matter how criminal they may be . One can find fault with the movie , but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based .
" The Dresser " is perhaps the most refined of backstage films . The film is brimming with wit and spirit , for the most part provided by the " energetic " character of Norman ( Tom Courtenay ) . Although his character is clearly gay , and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer ( Albert Finney ) that he assists , the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is . < br / > < br / > The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in " Bullitt " is again on display , and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence . This is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious . In the end , " The Dresser " will bore many people silly , but it will truly be a delight to those who love British cinema . < br / > < br / > 7.7 out of 10
I grew up in New York City and every afternoon ABC would show the 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember watching as a kid . I loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years . I recently watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe I am just a romantic - but I thought it was well done . I do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors - I really did not know who they were when I first saw this movie - I guess I just knew quality acting as a child . Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent . I especially loved seeing old New Orleans during the time period of this movie . If you ever get a chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during that time period - when you get to see some of the old homes in the French Quarter ( not just Bourbon Street ) or uptown , you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago . < br / > < br / > I love old movies - this one to me is a good flick ! !
I saw this film via one of the actors ' agents , and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth . Australia in terms of the overall * tone , * which is rightly dark and moody . < br / > < br / > I thought the little boy in the film was excellent . Mostly kid actors are * hammed up * and embarrassing but not in this case . He was really very good . In terms of the * surrealism * thingy mentioned by jingo , well , I just think this film is plain ' weird . ' It's a real weirdo film , with weirdo locations , storyline , weird stuff going on the whole time . But ' good ' weird as opposed to ' bad ' . < br / > < br / > Its hard to think of other movies like it , but its not at all like CARS ATE Paris , maybe more like a REPULSION , but actually I think more like a Hammer movie from the 60 ' s . Its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it . < br / > < br / > JINGO , My question is also about the title . Why Modern Love ? ? Anyone ? Also , jingo , what did you mean by " god Forsaken " when you were talking about Australia , hmmm ? Just curious
When you make a film with a killer-kids premise , there are two effective ways to approach it ; you can either make it as realistic as possible , creating believable characters and situations , or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs ( something which the makers of " Silent Night , Deadly Night " did , for example , on an equally controversial subject : a killer Santa ) . The people who made " Bloody Birthday " , however , do neither of those things ; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun ( or a knife , or a noose , or an arrow ) in his / her hand . The result is both offensive and stupid . The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production ( and then kept from release for several years ) . It's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids , but it's VERY sloppily made . ( * 1/2 )
I don't usually comment on films or TV shows but had to post a comment about Las Vegas . < br / > < br / > Naturally here in the UK we are about 2/3 rd's through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 ( via other means ) i'm still glued every Friday at 9pm . < br / > < br / > From the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on DVD , yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in October . < br / > < br / > So why do i love this show so much , well i have to agree with the last poster ... James Caan , i know one person cannot make a team but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan or maybe it was the other way around , i read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline ... Do'h no way ! ! ! i also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft , i also preferred the tough take no sh * t Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in season 1 & 2 , he seems to have mellowed out . < br / > < br / > As i said no one person makes the team by themselves's and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny , James LeSure / Mike , Vanessa Marcil / Sam , Nikki Cox / Mary , Molly Sims / Delinda all contribute well , even outside cast members such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline , Harry Groener as Gunther , Dean Caine as Casey , Mitchell Longley as Mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one . < br / > < br / > This show has everything , drama , action , suspense , laughs , romance , glitz's , glamour and big time celebrity's who often play themselves's . < br / > < br / > Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and i hope it may long continue after season 4 .
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me . The cast was beautiful , lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes . The locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water . It just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building , could attract so many beautiful , vulnerable , women . Only in the Mediterranean I guess . Certainly in no world I am familiar with . The macho men were really obnoxious , and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long . The screenplay , cinematography , directing , etc . was set up to deliver a Class B film , the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts . It was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film .
This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts , it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL , THRILLS , AND yes a lot of GORE ! ! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS ! ! ! In parts it was sort of far-fetched , the acting was not that great , but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten ... if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats , this is just the right movie for you , I have to admit , it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax ... I myself enjoy these museums , but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way !
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind . < br / > < br / > Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko . Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards . Donnie Darko is a thing of the past , get over it . < br / > < br / > Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the ' Deeper meaning ' the first time you watch them . To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it . < br / > < br / > The deeper meaning - ( to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble ) Humans are self serving , we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address . < br / > < br / > Summary : Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks . Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money . Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual . To spare my fingers the typing ... For pushing the button , Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings , in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race . < br / > < br / > I liked : The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines . Its different . Its intense . It has a deeper meaning ( although its philosophy 101 material ) . It leaves you guessing . NOT A Hollywood ENDING ! < br / > < br / > I disliked : Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme ? What god like alien has the patience for that ? Diaz was good , but was there a need for the country accent ? They live in Virginia . < br / > < br / > I give it a 7 because Kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies . Overall good flick .
Great film from the late 1970 ' s . Says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person , so that the powerful can gain gain huge profits and disregard the environment and safety of others . < br / > < br / > Nearly 30 years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate entities that since the films release have gained ten fold in their ability to control ; It shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit . < br / > < br / > Jack Lemmon is brilliant - while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are as equally compelling in their roles . The frivolous 70s where damned for much , this film redeems the decade . < br / > < br / > A film that becomes better after each watching .
The first opening scene that lasted around five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic , with moderit to good acting , good film , a story that keep the volume up , and an in the corner the of screen a spooky " did you see that ! " ( the scarecrow moves ) . < br / > < br / > After the quick set up of history that would come into the present , it was like someone else had written and directed the rest of the " film " . The next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck . It looks like the rest was shot in video , with crappy " porn style actors " , the set design was a lawyers office with practically nothing on the bookshelves or anything in the office at all . < br / > < br / > I remember only watching crap horror films for a chance of seeing some naked " teenage " girls , back then there weren't Victoria's Secret mags everywhere , and not watching for things that make great horror films of today like acting , terror , suspense , intregue , and so on . < br / > < br / > It took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die . When it did , me and and my friends were so shocked by the WORST costume of a " monster " EVER , we through our popcorn at the TV screen booing .
Once upon a time Theresa Russell made a few halfway decent movies , so I keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 ( out of 10 ) . However , DARK WORLD is just the latest in a string of disappointments . The first 90 minutes are very hard to watch . The lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session ( in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents , but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading ) . The sets and props seem " off " somehow ( what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders ? ) . The screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and datelines , which appear with no rhyme or reason . Now , if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening , they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are REALLY clever clues to the plot turning topsy-turvy in this misfire's final five minutes . Well , for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are TV : THE MOVIE and SURFER , DUDE ; they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement . But it is hard to believe that ANYONE who has seen 10 or more movies in their life--and is not a close friend or relative of a DARK WORLD cast or crew member--could fall for such a lame canard . Despite what the d . v . d . box might lead you to believe , this movie has about as much resemblance to SUNSET BOULEVARD ( dead narrator device ) or Hitchcock ( schizophrenic protagonist device ) as a drained Jim Beam bottle refilled with urine has to booze !
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I ... well .. you know . The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger ( Eli Wallach ) " captures " his prey ( Anne Jackson ) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious . Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean ( ? ) or department head is priceless . How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end ? This film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class , race , sex or religion . And who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn !
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday . There are good and bad in EVERY race , why make them all out to be bad ? That goes for all races today . John Harper was an educated man , he graduated from high school , he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve . How do I know this ? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school , and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation . He was a kind and gentle soul , he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right . I wasn't very old when he left our house , but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn't be bothered . He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg . None of this is mentioned in the movie , and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as I'm concerned . What happened to John is unforgivable , not only in the native community , but also in the white community . Not everyone in Winnipeg think like the police do , I knew the person inside , and what he was like as a PERSON , not an Indian !
As is frequently the case when Manga is translated into live action , there is quite a bit lost in the translation . However , this remains a highly entertaining film . The premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet , understated style so prevalent in Japanese films ( ha ! ) . The special effects are a little 70s camp but , it adds to the comic book feel of the film . I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but , if you are familiar with ( and enjoyed ) other Japanese horror films like " Evil Dead's Trap " , this film will appeal to you .
Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash , and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class . This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen . It totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present , so the story is just really really dull . Thank god the 80 ' s are over , and god save whatever man was actually born as " James Bond III " .
This is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game I have ever encountered . Every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't walk through . The cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements , but only to a slight degree . Also , you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro / tutorials . It's terrible ! I am afraid if I play this game any more I will end up breaking something . This game sucks . The graphics are good , but nothing special , the game play , however , is awful . To say I hate this game would be a huge understatement . I got it on sale , but I want my $ 20 back . What a waste !
Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies . This one is from a guy in love with his own writing . It isn't Inglorious , its disgusting . < br / > < br / > I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds . The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining ! ! ! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit , it is extreme boredom or disgust . < br / > < br / > The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages . There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table , before , thankfully they are all shot . I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes . Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F * * K up . < br / > < br / > This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark , but in other films , I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking . Here , I couldn't care less . All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence , particularly Jackie Brown . But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene , Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film . < br / > < br / > Is it violent ? Sure there's torture and scalping galore , but you'd have to remind me . Thankfully , the film was so thin , I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC . < br / > < br / > He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel . But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie . < br / > < br / > I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is . < br / > < br / > I give it 0 / 10 .
One of the most macabre , depressing , yet eye-opening docs . I've watched in awhile . There's no narration or story that's told , just a " third eye " type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons . Watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then " clean " their needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather . < br / > < br / > Anyone currently in recovery of alcohol / drug addition should watch this when they're craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to ! After seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with . < br / > < br / > The only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today . Judging from what is shown in the doc . , there's no hope for any of them . They mention wanting to get better and quit , but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying . < br / > < br / > This definitely isn't for all audiences . I found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after I started watching it I just couldn't turn it off . I had to keep watching with a dark / morbid fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts .
I watched this series after I had seen the Naked Gun films . I found it much better than the films , and I thought the films were great ! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun , sight gag , or funny situation ( the all night wicker place , club flamingo ) . I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a TV series in my life , even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes . I think its a shame that only six episodes were produced , but I agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes . Overall , the series is a must see for those who like puns , bad jokes , and slapstick sight-gags .
Was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lonesome Dove but this was total garbage . Cinematography was terrible . Shot way too tight . Was almost viewing the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope . Editing was cut , cut , cut . Not even smooth . More like a bad student editor . Don't know if McMurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible . Really like Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ? ? ? I have no idea . Even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets . How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove gone so wrong with this ? Where was his head ... Can't say much for the acting either . It's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can . Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way . Not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was . < br / > < br / > ( 2nd post ) ... OK , since nothing else was on TV I must be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon . And I will be honest to tell you that I didn't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep ! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could pick out some mannerisms that Steve Zahn did while portraying the character that Duval did such an excellent job with . So I must give Zahn credit for that . As for Karl Urban's portrayal ... simple dead meat . Can only say again that I was very disappointed only because I cared so much for the original LD and like others ... have defended my feelings for a truly great western .
Like the other comments says , this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica . But have you already seen Delicatessen , there is nothing new it this film . I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out , but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest . I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now , like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again . There is really no point to the film , nothing that really matter or stays with you . There may be a distant similarity to the films of Kusturica , but he's really in a different league , so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on Tuvalu .
This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released . The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women . The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Das . < br / > < br / > The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible . The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie . The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas . < br / > < br / > Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public
I've come to realise through watching this sort of film that I don't like them very much . Caged Women is yet another ' women in prison ' film , and like the most of the rest of the genre ; the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women . Now don't get me wrong ; I love nude women , but I also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity , and since this film has only the basic ' women are in prison ' theme running through it ( aswell as the essential escape , of course ) , I got a bit bored before the end . The film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes , but that's about the only positive element . Director ( and writer , ha ha ) Erwin C . Dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body , but it's never very erotic . The director was the producer on a number of trash flicks , including some directed by Jess Franco . In my opinion , he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non-existent , and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene . This sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time , but I reckon Franco could have made more out of it . Overall , this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff ; but I can't say I enjoyed it .
I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network . It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 60 ' s ( Time Tunnel etc ) . Excellent effects ( they beat Star Trek 5 done 20 years later , but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish ) . < br / > < br / > I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production . They would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters ' level , but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting ( especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro - politics , surprisingly similar to today's European Union ! ) < br / > < br / > The plot is indeed reminiscent of Twilight Zone in general ( as other users have pointed ) , but in this case it's a compliment . < br / > < br / > Great sets , by the way ! < br / > < br / > 7/10
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith ( Wesley Snipes ) has tracked down a arms dealer named Dimitru ( Matthew Leitch ) , things go wrong though & Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US Government . After a big shoot-out most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about , top man Flint ( Michael Brandon ) decides to send Sonni back to the US & at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski ( Silvia Colloca ) who is also being sent back to the US . However it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru & his football club owning boss Jozef ( Tim Dutton ) who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in Washington killing millions of people ... < br / > < br / > This American & Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are relegated to making generic action films in Eastern European locations , yep Snipes has joined such luminaries as Jean-Claude Van Damme , Steven Seagal , Dolph Lundgren , Rutger Hauer & Chuck Norris . I give Snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade : Trinity ( 2004 ) still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds ( every film he has made since has gone straight-to-DVD ) but it had to happen sooner or later , like a lot of the names I've mentioned Snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films & if you look at his career he's been in more bad films that good ones . Like the recent films of JCVD & Seagal The Detonator is pretty awful . The script by Martin Wheeler is as predictable , boring & by-the-numbers as anything out there . The Detonator is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable TV channel playing at 2 O'clock in the morning . The Detonator is chock full of clichés , Snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman & at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love , his closest friend at the CIA turns out to be a traitor while the obnoxious by the book boss no-one likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy , Snipes character is allowed to run around Bucharest shooting , killing & blowing people up like it doesn't matter & he never gets arrested , the action is dull & forgettable , the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football terminology & there aren't even any funny one-liners . < br / > < br / > Director Leong doesn't do anything anything to liven things up , The Detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the 30mph mark . OK the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few & far between & utterly forgettable in a ' bad guy shoots at Snipes & misses , in return Snipes shoots at bad guy & kills him ' sort of way . There's a half decent car crash & explosion but very little else . It seems some of The Detonator was shot in a Romanian football stadium , I think I'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this film . < br / > < br / > With a supposed budget of about $ 15,000 , 000 The Detonator is reasonably well made but not that much really happens . Set & filmed in Bucharest in Romania . The acting isn't that great , Snipes just doesn't seem interested & feels like he is just there for the money which I don't blame him for at all . < br / > < br / > The Detonator is yet another poor clichéd action film starring a has been actor & set in Eastern Europe . Why do Sony keep making these things ? Not recommend , there are much better action fare out there .
I do not see what is the whole deal about this movie . Patricia Kaas sings , yes , and that makes the film charming , but singing is not enough . I mean , if you want to get all benefits of this one , go buy Patricia's CD and enjoy ! The plot is simple ( if to omit the " dreams " ); the main characters seem to love each other instantly , and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances . Relationships appear almost " mandatory " , and the little " detective story " thrown in just makes things worse . What at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending , is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream . I measure movies by how well I would remember them , and for this one , I already started to forget the details .
This definitely the most tension filled X-Files episode of the first season . this episode is what I think of when I hear " X-Files " . the plot is simple but exiting . Our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an Alskan outpost in which it's research team appears to have killed each other . It turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice , had infected the research team . The parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity . Soon none can tell who they can trust , or who's infected or not . < br / > < br / > This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenters great horror film " the THING " . the Thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it's occupant have been killed or killed themselves . An alien that had been buried in the ice for a 1000 years had been thawed out . It has the abilities to imitate any life form . therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes . < br / > < br / > Believe me The THING is one of the most exiting , and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see . if you liked the episode ICE I advice you to see it . Or if you have only seen the THING I advice you to see ICE . < br / > < br / > ICE is the best direct tribute / homage to John Carpenter's The THING I have ever seen , and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best X-Files episodes . I give it a 10/10 .
This show can most accurately be described as TV Bubble-Gum : It's chewing , it has a good taste to it , and it lasts a long time . But , like Bubble-Gum , it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews . < br / > < br / > This show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games , like Hangman , guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list . Callers are the contestants , and anybody can play . < br / > < br / > The questions , though , are terribly easy . There's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop . It never seems to get old , but it never adds much to the show anyway . The hostess , however , regardless of which one that it , is extremely personable , pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions . I rather enjoy that British woman . < br / > < br / > But there's nothing to this show . It's simplistic and uncompelling , although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on .
Not having any idea what this film was about , but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it , we decided to watch it . Well , it turned out not to be the wisest decision . In fact , as another commentary in this forum puts it , we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie . < br / > < br / > While the film is by no means horrible , it doesn't make sense at all . The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn't help the situation either . John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better . The basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way . The result is an uneven film .
This show should be titled , " When Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors " considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues , e . g . Andre Braugher in Homicide : Life on the Street and David Morse in St . Elsewhere . I'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd I wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be . We're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out , almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel , sentenced to redeem himself from sins , both venial and mortal , via butting into his cab fares many affairs . Watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief , that Mike Olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers . That he possesses those " Super-Cop " abilities , to be all things to all people , weapons expert , martial arts master , psychologist , father-confessor , locksmith , and so on , ad infinitum . Pure drivelesque fantasy . What is it about recent televisions shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child ? Overdone . I wanted to like this show , really I did , because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors . But I'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution .
I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films . Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America . I have seen movies make fun of themselves , but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors , awful props , and awful music to be taken seriously . I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie . How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled " Generic Ninja Fight Scene , Op . 1 " or " Variations on A Bad Guy Pointing a Gun at a Girl's Head When Backed into a Corner " or the daring " Flight of the Helicopter " . Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled . Those actually had me in tears laughing . If the " special effects " weren't proof enough that this was low-budget , the fact that only two or three of the crew members , presumably locals which although good for the much-needed Phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money , have ever done anything since this series of movies . They rented equipment , despite making sequels to this movie . That was pretty funny too . The thing that really had me going though , was not the music ( which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from G . I . Joe to pop up ) , but the ending ... I suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil , but when the American Ninja drops the girl into Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask , I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson drop the girl to catch him . < br / > < br / > I think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie .
This show is really great . It's smart.It ' s funny.It ' s great acting and writing . This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen . The Dialogues are really funny and well acted . Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter . This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter , they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily . Just watch this show I highly recommend it.It ' s great and definitely the best show on the air . Season 7 stars Tuesday September 26th , 2006 , 8/ 7c on the new The CW
I remember this film as the other person that commented said . I recorded over it but wish I had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever . Funny , in a real bad way . I remember the tag line on the box was " The ultimate frontal lobotomy " . I got it from my mom , who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / cheesiest movie she had ever seen , so my mom said " My son will probably love it . " and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession . I then later taped over it , which I regret . I also remember the " corck screw " thing was one of those ball catcher things ... the yellow cone shaped things , with a red " button " at the end , and when you hit the red thing , it sends a ball flying . Well , they used that with a crank on one end , and a corkscrew in the funnel . When the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the " weapon " and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head . I don't know what else to say about this " gem " except that if you like bad films , it doesn't get any worse than this .
The title suggests that this movie is a sequel to " An American werewolf in London " . None of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name . So as a sequel , AAwiP fails , one would say . < br / > < br / > I dare to say the opposite . < br / > < br / > An American werewolf in Paris is a charming , effective horror movie . It's one of the better werewolf films I have seen in a long time too . And I have seen quite my share , such as An American werewolf in London , The Howling , Wolfen , The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy . < br / > < br / > The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on a vacation . At the top of the Eifel Tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide . What starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed ... < br / > < br / > I really liked the acting in this film . Especially the two stars of the movie : the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her . They have good chemistry together . But the other two Americans also play their roles nicely . I didn't really find anything annoying about the acting , so thumbs up for that ! < br / > < br / > The effects on the werewolves are nice . It doesn't look too cheap or fake to me . Of course , the opinions are divided about this subject . But let's just say that I wasn't disappointed . < br / > < br / > There's also a good amount of humor in this movie . There are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time . < br / > < br / > So , to sum it up , An American werewolf in Paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor , but it's still an enjoyable movie . Perfect for fans of werewolves ! 7 out of 10 stars !
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie . I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times , but in it's genre it is a great movie . I know , not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like ' Robin Hood ' is turned into a comedy . Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong . < br / > < br / > Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood : Men in Tights . I have seen the original Robin Hood movies as well , but I never had such a good time when watching them as I had with this one . It's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies ( Winston Churchil , The Godfather ... ) . < br / > < br / > I recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie . To those who think Robin Hood shouldn't be messed with , you're wrong , but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it . I give this movie an 8/ 10 .
This film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and , I find that I keep watching it over and over again . The performances are wonderful , and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film . < br / > < br / > Maybe I am too often distracted when watching films at home , you know the drill , the dogs bark , the phone rings , the popcorn finishes during the credits . But this film is about people and what motivates us , what enlivens us , what causes rifts between us , and what inspires us . < br / > < br / > For me , it is films like The Love Letter that keep me taking a chance on new films . Frankly , I am surprised that the film is not better known . I would love to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many more roles . They are a delight to watch . Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no previous idea that she would be . Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief . < br / > < br / > This film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions . I find it refreshing every time I take the time to watch it .
Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie . The first time my Mom told me about it I was 7 and Saint Anne had just been the Saint I had for my Communion Saint . My Mom knew this , so she told me to watch this with her . I did , and have seen it many times since because it is really funny . Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street . So , there were lots of actors we seen on TV shows too . There is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away , and Sally keeps trying things with St . Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house . That includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays her older brother . This is a good and funny movie that I still love .
Alfred Hitchcock's " Saboteur " ( 1942 ) ( not to be confused with another Hitchcock film , " Sabotage " made in 1936 which has a completely different plot ) is not the Master of Suspense greatest film . It dose not have the depth of " Vertigo " ( 1958 ) nor the brooding atmosphere of " Rebbeca " ( 1940 ) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in " Notorious " ( 1946 ) , but what it dose have is thrills , adventure and a nail biting climax . The two leads , admittedly , are quite weak . It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken by Priscilla Lane . Also , the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says ( that were written by Dorothy Parker ) have dated badly , and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done ( the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false ) . However , the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing , the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done , and the film is a clear predecessor of " North By Northwest " ( 1959 ) . The two villains , Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence . This not the best film Hitch made , but it is surly one of his most entertaining .
Historical drama is one of the areas where the British just can't be beat . So while i'm not a huge fan of the genre , i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's British and with decent actors . < br / > < br / > I have never read anything by Sarah Waters , which is of course something i should do . Hence i didn't really know what to expect from this . I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story , but not much more . While watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated . Without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted . Although there were almost a twist too many somewhere , it took me a minute to get everything straight . < br / > < br / > Production values are good , the actors are very solid and the pace is decent , although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour . That might just be me though , i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished . All in all though , this is a fairly enjoyable three hours . I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas .
Dramatic license - some hate it , though it is necessary in retelling any life story . In the case of " Lucy " , the main points of Lucille Ball's teenage years , early career and 20 year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included , albeit in a truncated and reworked way . < br / > < br / > The main emotional points of Lucy's life are made clear : Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress , finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend ; her turbulent , romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz ; Lucy & Desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV's most memorable sitcom couple . < br / > < br / > As Lucille Ball , Rachel York does a commendable job . Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one Judy Davis made when playing Judy Garland , but York makes Ball strong-willed yet likable , and is very funny in her own right . Even though her comedic-timing is different than Lucy's , she is still believable . The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set , and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early " I Love Lucy " years , but watching York portray Lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion . < br / > < br / > Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi was , but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with Desi's accent , especially in the opening scene . Madeline Zima was decent , if not overly memorable , as the teen-aged Lucy . < br / > < br / > Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not featured much , thankfully , since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles . Not that they aren't good actors in their own right , they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing . Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland , and the repressed accents are detectable at times . < br / > < br / > Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact , there are many deviations , some for seemingly inexplicable reasons . Jess Oppenheimer , the head writer of Lucy's radio show " My Favourite Husband " which began in 1948 , is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with " I Love Lucy " in 1951 , completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator ! This movie also depicts Marc Daniels as being the main " I Love Lucy " director for its entire run , completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season ! Also , though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints , the Ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York , when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 . The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well . The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original , except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured . < br / > < br / > There's also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953 , during Lucy's red-scare incident , even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957 . These changes well could have been for dramatic license , and the film does work at conveying the main facts , but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher , two vital figures in " I Love Lucy " history ? The biggest gaff comes in the " I Love Lucy " recreation scenes , at least a few of them . It's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people , but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made . The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated , and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away ! The " We're Having A Baby " number was shortened as well , but other than that it was practically dead on . By far the best was the " grape-stomping " scene , with Rachel York really nailing Lucy's mannerisms . The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the " Vitametavegamin " and candy factory bits , instead showing the actors rehearse them . These scenes proved effective because of that approach . < br / > < br / > The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about Lucy's life , since much is skimmed over or omitted at all . Overall , though , it gives a decent portrait of Lucy & Desi's marriage , and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively .
A wonderful Christmas story on the moving theme of " Susie Homemaker finds her Inner Amazon . " No , I'm serious ! Geena Davis's amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head . From this familiar beginning , we move in an unexpected direction . Good pace , good action , fun story , lots of explosions and mayhem .
Joe ( Wes ) & Jim ( Adam ) re-acquaint us with the beauty , isolation ( psychological as well as physical ) and utter terror of " murder most fowl " in the Navaho Southwest . Characterizations , settings and plot continually build .. . even if at times the personal asides leave us wanting " more " .. . with some interesting alternative choices as to " who done it ? " Flashbacks ( e . g . Peter Fonda . .. good to see him ) provide clues but they don't go where you might think . Comic asides ( e . g . the Preacher ) are mild and appropriate . Where " Skinwalkers " and " Coyote Waits " start to drag .. . " Thief " engages the clutch and four-wheels you around the next corner , never quite sure what's there . Disagree with Joe Leaphorn's manic comment to Jim Chee to " slow down " for the potholes . Wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot , just tracks to follow . On to the next episode ! Great photography ( as always ) , appealing characters and more to explore !
Intelligent summary , isn't it ? < br / > < br / > If Mad Max was something of a simple , straight forward , nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film , they totally made up for it with it's sequel , The Road Warrior . So , in theory , with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy ... now , it's not ! < br / > < br / > Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was ! It's main premise is pretty cool , with an ' underworld ' ( think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine ) , but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction . Add the obnoxious Tina Turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane , and this is just one huge stinker . < br / > < br / > Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 ( although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing ) , because this just isn't right . < br / > < br / > 3/10 .
I have watched my fair bit of Bollywood films when growing up - you know the typical plot boy meets girl , girl rejects boys , dakus ( bad guys ) take away girl , boy rescues girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they happily get married ( of course I've omitted an hour of musical style numbers ) .. Well going into watch Hari Om , I was expecting another typical Bollywood style movie ; however , to my delight it turned out to be atypical and indeed quite comical . Bharatbala's Hari Om is what could be labeled as one of those ' off beat ' Indian films such as the ever popular South Asian hits as Monsoon Wedding , East is East or Bend it Like Beckham . < br / > < br / > Being of South Asian decent and having watched various classic Bollywood films , there was much humour and sub-dialogs which could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of Indian culture ( e . g . , the various Indo-pop numbers which were actually remade by Nitin Soni or the witty Indian slangs that were used ) . Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians , and is also entertaining for those not accustom to the Indian humor as the characters and plot caters to all audiences . < br / > < br / > In a cocunutshell , the movie is of auto-rickshaw driver ( aka ' four-wheeler ' for those of you who have traveled to India know ) played by Vija Raaz ( from Monsoon Wedding ) who gets himself involved with a crook and ends up owing him quite a bit of money . To avoid selling his four-wheeler , ' Madhuri ' , he escapes serendipitously with ' Madhuri ' and a very charismatic and lovely woman from France , Isa ( Camille Natta ) , who herself is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit ( Jean Marie Lamour who was in Swimming Pool ) . The movie is of their journey traveling across the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan  the land of love stories ; through the humour you see the two main actors trying to find out who they are really are . < br / > < br / > What made the night most memorable was having the director , executive producer , main editor and even the mother of Ms . Natta present at the screening . After speaking with Bharatbala ( who actually has a Zoology background ) many interesting tidbits of the film were uncovered including : having the film finished only 10 days prior to the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to shoot , and having only five actors in the play ( the rest were all first time real actors ) . Arriving home I realized two things from the movie - that there is always a human connection between any one of us despite our differences and secondly , as the director had put it ' Everybody has a love story ' . < br / > < br / > Its a Must SEE for everyone !
If you have never heard of Jane Austen , seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation , or even seen a pop up version of the book , then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable . < br / > < br / > From the opening scene , this film must be remembered for its awful acting , abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen . < br / > < br / > Whoever decided to cast actors ( with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench ) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen , let alone read her , should be punished ! Keira Knightley grimaces and grins through every scene , and came across as being so obnoxious that no-one would want to marry her ! Darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written . < br / > < br / > This version failed to show the proper Pride and Prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered from and , at the end of the longest two hours of my life , who cared whether they got together or not ! Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this rubbish . I cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended !
I have watched this movie quite bemused . I am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a Rob Zombie type affair or an exploration of real events . < br / > < br / > In either case it missed its mark . It's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story . < br / > < br / > The performances were neither compelling nor bad . < br / > < br / > For me , I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect .
Frank Falenczyk : It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them ; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly . < br / > < br / > Wow ! Talk about a swing and a miss . You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties ... how do you f_ck that up ? ! Well , apparently John Dahl has found a way . With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable , ' You Kill Me ' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007 . On a positive note , Ben Kinglsey provides another great performance as the alcoholic Polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap . Tea Leoni is good as well as is Luke Wilson , Dennis Farina , Bill Pullman , Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast . I guess the best way to describe ' You Kill Me ' is a terrible movie with good performances . Grade : D +
When I first saw this movie , I also expected " our boys " to be cute , and more like an extended version of the TV show . I didn't " get it " back then . But , years later , at a party YEARS later , at a 70s ' type PAR-TAY , where certain substances had been smoked , inhaled , and with plenty of tequila , " HEAD " was on late at night.We watched it , and finally realized what " HEAD " was all about . It spoofed their own show , as shown in one song that called themselves , " a manufactured image " . As Davy Jones wrote in his autobio , " They Made a Monkey out of me " , he openly admits that everyone in the film , had been up all night smoking weed.They made fun of themselves , society , everything ! Great film ! Tho , as a 52 yr old granny , I no longer " induldge " , I STILL watch this film when I want a good LOL ! ! !
In the seedy streets somewhere in New York City , a lonely punk named Tromeo ( Will Keenan ) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos , piercing and just party all the time . He does fall for a beautiful rich girl named Juliet ( Jane Jenson ) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what , but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them . Unfortunately their fathers are at each other as Juliet's dad wants to take over Tromeo's dad's movie studio , but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud ? < br / > < br / > Hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at Troma is a wonderful modern day take on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet . This was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all , it's got some good laughs , piercing , graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant . For me this is the third best Troma movie next to the immortal " Toxic Avenger " and " Troma's War " being second , yes the acting can be a little bad like some Troma flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies , Peter Jackson , and Troma or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story , BTW also look for a couple of amusing appearances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT . Kabukiman NYPD . < br / > < br / > Also recommended : " The Toxic Avenger " , " Meet The Feebles " , " Ichi The Killer " , " Re-Animator " , " Terror Firmer " , " Class of Nuke'Em High " , " Romeo and Juliet ( 1968 and 1996 ) " , " Pieces " , " Troma's War " , " Citizen Toxie : The Toxic Avenger 4 " , " Basket Case " , " Riki-Oh : The Story of Ricky " , " Demons " , " New Nightmare " , " Freddy Vs . Jason " , " Cabin Fever " , " Nightmare on Elm Street " , " Battle Royale " , " Pink Flamingos " , " Perfect Blue " , " Rabid Grannies " , " Surf Nazis Must Die " , " Hostel " , " Evil Dead II " , " Serial Mom " , " Dead Alive ( a . k . a . Braindead ) " , " Street Trash " .
Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting . < br / > < br / > The make-up done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic . It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground . It was really a treat to see the quality of work . < br / > < br / > It wasn't particularly horrible , as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer . < br / > < br / > I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also . Nothing spectacular , but fair . This was only Anne Bobby's third film , and she was good also . < br / > < br / > The ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts , as did David Cronenberg . Ha !
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey . He hooks her up with a telephone , and she teaches him how to Charleston . Then they fly off in the spaceship , leaving the monkey behind . Cringe-inducing blackface aside , this short film makes no sense . I think that's the plot , but I'm not sure by a long shot . You can't tell that this is Renoir at work , despite his characteristic humanism . Good use of slow-motion , though . Can be found on the NY Film Annex's series of Experimental Film videos , No . 18 , I believe .
This flick is so bad its beyond belief.Even for an independent low budget film ... it just , well , sucks . I can't even believe even Troma would put out such crap . I have been a fan of some Troma flicks for years ( Toxic Avenger , Squeeze Play , Rockabilly Vampire to name a few ) . But LLoyd , come on , this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste.It features some of the worst acting imaginable . I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good ... oh , wait , that is what they did . I mean it , these characters have negative charisma.With any luck , the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.As will the special effects people.But beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects , the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.The script is full of plot holes the size of Alaska , and there are severe continuity problems.The worst part however , is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.And this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.But , don't take my word for it.Go out and waste four bucks renting it.Just don't say I didn't warn you .
I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story . While there could be a twist , this twist was so significant , that I felt betrayed . I believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better . The writer could have revealed more of the ' twists ' throughout the movie , rather than all at once at the end . That aside , I believe that the actors did very well with what they had , particularly Matt Damon , who actually had a little character in his character , little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing . The other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another . The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone .
Wow ! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs ( lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie ) Terrible acting , the killer is quite far from scary , I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier . Lot's of unnecessary ' skin ' in this film , pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million , a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film . I could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this . I don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone ...
I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews . The film is dated of course , and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now . But even allowing for this , Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost laughable . < br / > < br / > The scripting is awful , just awful , with no characterisation at all . The performances suffer as a result , you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines . The writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for him / herself at all . The beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece ; I know they had American audiences to take into consideration , but the patronising way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful . < br / > < br / > I honestly can't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film . Even allowing for the comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience , this movie truly stinks .
Yes , I give it a 10 because I compare it not only to others of it's kind but also to the dreck one is bombarded with on a daily basis in what's laughably called today's " popular culture . " That aside , the film is beautifully cast , as has been stated elsewhere , and gives us a fairly good look at popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries . No small coincidence is that many of the plays that Olcott played in involved a similar plot : Boy meets girl , someone objects , ( usually the father or some authority figure ) boy struggles , boy wins girl . The was actually known at the time as a " Chauncey Olcott Act . " No coincidence , too , that John Ford directed one . He called it , " The Quiet Man . " And , " My Wild Irish Rose , " is , in itself , a " Chauncey Olcott act . " Great stuff , no ? Anyway , great songs , great stuff . Enjoy . < br / > < br / > PS - After seeing the film I'd like to know more about Bill Scanlan . I found an obit that said he quit " Mauvorneen , " as a result of insanity ( replaced , as in the film , by Chauncey Olcott ) and died in an asylum several years later . But he had been , apparenlty , a very big star in his own right , who wrote songs and plays and had plays written for him . < br / > < br / > Anyone know more ?
I watched this movie the night it premiered on MTV . Usually to me MTV Movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good . Summer Phoenix is an amazing actress and I thought that Nick Stahl was good too . If MTV started showing more movies like this I would probably enjoy the channel a lot more .
What's up with this movie ? Does Mr . Lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic fling between two screwed up Yuppies can carry a feature length movie ? Maybe if it had some comedic elements ( which is doesn't , at least intentionally ) , or there were some additional dramatic elements ( which there are not ) , or maybe if it was hardcore . No , it's simply the history of the affair ; a chronology of a bunch of R-rated trysts . Ho-hum , who cares ? " Nine ½ Weeks " deserves every Razzie nomination it got . It's a loser . < br / > < br / > And by the way , what's up with Roger Ebert and his rave review ? Where was his head back in 1986 ?
Title : Opera ( 1987 ) Director : Dario Argento Cast : Cristina Masillach , Ian Charleson , Urbano Barberini , Daria Nicolodi Review : The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria and that one blew me away with its style , colors and spooky story line . I next decided to go with Opera as I had been told it was one of his best . Man , I think I'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors . < br / > < br / > Opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on Mc Beth gets hit by a car . Betty is the understudy so she gets to do the part herself . Too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers . < br / > < br / > Wow , Id heard good things about this here flick , but I wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me . Yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which Ill get to later . But for the most part the movie blew me away . < br / > < br / > First off , this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as Suspiria . I was expecting it to be a bit like suspiria in that department , but no , to my surprise it had its own look and feel . The film is somehow devoid of color . It does have lots in colors in certain scenes ( like the masterful kitchen / living room sequence ) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues , but for the most part the film has a grayish , black tone to it all through out and I liked that it had its own distinctive look . < br / > < br / > The real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences . Wow . Every death scene was like a work of art . Beauty in destruction . These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences , these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations . Loved every second of them , there's plenty of blood and mayhem here , but with style . Not gonna spoil em though . < br / > < br / > Then there's the direction . Man , there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one . I loved the inventive use of the camera on this one . You thought that Tarantinos shot in Kill Bill vol . 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original ? Well this is the movie he lifted it from ! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol . 1 . Heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos , and here my friends is the proof of that . Anyhows , Tarantino references aside , this movie has some amazing camera shots , like those scenes of the crows flying through the crowd in the opera house ... great stuff . And a main reason why Argentos becoming one of my favorites . < br / > < br / > The acting from most of the cast was alright , but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty . The looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great . The rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff , but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the film . < br / > < br / > There were very few things I didn't like about this movie . First off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes . Specially those involving Bettys reactions after shes seen the murders . It seem to me that for the longest time , she just went on about her business , not telling anyone about the whole thing . Not even the police . I mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes ... you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life . Someone would have connected her to the murders . She might have even become a suspect herself ... but no . Also the ending is a bit anti climactic . You'll have to see this to understand , but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended , it felt like it could have ended earlier . It would not have felt so redundant . But thats about it , not real big problems for me really since I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film . < br / > < br / > I've still got a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I'm devouring every step of the way like if I was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar . This guys really good . I think of his films as works of art , and I've only seen two of em ! Cant wait to discover the rest of his films . Argento , you the man ! < br / > < br / > Rating : 41/2 out of 5
The movie has a good story line , the action is good in some parts , but not all of them . Some of the parts , I just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have dosed off yet , from my experience from taking Martial arts . Some are the actions are long , like always mostly for the boss , but for the least important ones , they were killed or dosed off with a few hits , but some where quite unrealistic or could have done a better job at . < br / > < br / > The least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie , my girlfriend started to have a crush on them that she started to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me . < br / > < br / > The movie is good , that is all I can say .
I saw this mini-series when I was in high school . I remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling . At the time , I knew none of the British actors in the series , but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it , including Sean Connery ( the original James Bond among many other roles ) , Judi Dench ( Queen Elizabeth in " Shakespeare in Love " among many other roles ) and Eilene Atkins ( probably best known for creating " Upstairs / Downstairs " but also superb in many acting roles ) . Like the other commentator , I would like to see it again . I'm certain the production remains timeless , and I would hope that it has been or will be released on VHS or DVD . If you get a chance to see it , do not miss it .
After visiting the Kimbell museum in Forth-Worth , Texas , USA , enjoying the art and the architecture ( also of the adjacent Modern Art Museum ) , and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady , I purchased this a propos DVD with rather high expectations and was not disappointed in the least . < br / > < br / > The thematic approach , dramatic tension , revealing interviews , archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I . Khan . < br / > < br / > The documentary begins : contemplative classical music plays , archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed , blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape  a journey  , focus and out of focus , the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper . Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive and his death announced . < br / > < br / > " When I first read that obituary , I have to admit , I was looking for my own name . I was his child too , his only son . I didn't know my father very well . He never married my mother and he never lived with us ( ) He died when I was eleven . " < br / > < br / > So years later , this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure , but who's secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it . < br / > < br / > " For years , I struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my father's life I've been allowed to see , but it wasn't enough . I needed to know him . I needed to find out who he really was . So I set out on a journey , to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there . It would take me to the other side of the world , looking for the man who left me with so many questions . " < br / > < br / > So the documentary is two-fold , by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renown architect , we get to know : 1 ) his ideas , buildings and the architectural perspective and 2 ) his families , coworkers , people's life he affected and the human perspective < br / > < br / > The DVD also offers added insight with a Q & A with the writer / director and additional footage that includes such great Louis I . Khan quotes as " Everything that everybody says is the truth . It's their truth . It might not be factual . " and " A good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all . " < br / > < br / > This movie is a journey of discovery . Self-discovery and discovery of a man , a great man , yet a human , imperfect like all of us . We get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son , but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging . < br / > < br / > By key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity . We slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from Bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments . < br / > < br / > Brilliant architect , brilliant documentary .
Just been on sci-fi channel UK , 5th July , its was * * * . Shame on JRD ! May be he was bored one week ! He cant be skint after LOTR . I suppose he wasn't to blame . Mr Sheppird was . I turned off after 50 minutes , couldn't bear it . The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat . Who funded this project ? I think the whole thing must have cost $ 250 bucks . Avoid at all costs , don't think about buying the DVD if they release one , I cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one . Lets hope someone makes a decent Chupra film and a decent BIGFOOT movie . Sasquatch was okay , poor Lance . Its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it , no more super hero films please !
Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old . He was created by Walt Disney , a famous creater , producer , director etc : I love the Disney Movies because it is great fun watching the cartoon movies . Altogether Walt Disney i think is the king of the creations , Everyone has got to love this creations and the movies by Walt Disney . Thank you Walt for all the classic characters you made .
When I read the synopsis for " Messiah " in the television guide , I was not prepared for what was in store . The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across London . He soon realises a pattern , there is a serial killer on the loose , killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 Apostles and their killings are identical to their matching Apostle . The two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat , with Metcalfe closely pursuing the killer , but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill-fated victim . " Messiah " is sure to cause a great deal of controversy , but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the BBC has shown in a long time .
This film would like to be the kind of shocking , cerebral , and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been , but it's not . It is at best confusing and absurd . When the twists and turns finally revealed themselves , rather than saying " Ahh , I get it ! " I muttered something along the lines of " Okay ... whatever . " In my opinion , when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself . But this movie does have a flashback ; and here's the kicker : it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie ! < br / > < br / > The characters were stereotypical , unsympathetic , and wholly ridiculous . I feel that the " steamy " love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that I've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn . It seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes , but they were really just plain silly . < br / > < br / > And don't EVEN get me started on the crappy accents and second-rate sets . I guess the movie was set in New Orleans , but Aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in Anytown , USA . < br / > < br / > My recommendation : don't bother !
Darling Lili is fantastic ! Its by far one my favorite films ! It certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received . Julie Andrews , playing the title role of Lili Smith ( Schmidt ) is the best part of the whole movie . She is entrancing and spectacular ! As Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far , I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is . This movie is just ... great ( I'm running out of adjectives ! ) , it's magnificent , marvellous , amazing , funny , terribly romantic , sad , and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews ! And to her husband , director Blake Edwards . Oh , yeah Rock Hudson was ok , too :) < br / > < br / > Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer , Lili Smith . Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee , who quickly falls for Lili , and she with him . But their affair was not coincedental . There meeting was planned by the German Government ( I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them , but you get the point ) , because the warm , happy , singing entertainer Lili is actually a German Spy . Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion ( later know as " Crepe Suzette " ) . Though Lili is on a solemn mission , she falls in love with Bill ( Major Larabee ) , for real , making her original quest challenging . But Lili pulls through and completes er task , after she finds out something that is not really true about Bill . The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out . If anything , you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie , I most certainly did ! ! ! < br / > < br / >
The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world , and for good reason . Nonetheless , sitting through this documentary about her life , which fills in some of the details where the diary left off , I thought , " Just another documentary about Anne Frank . " I found it to be competent but not extraordinary . That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank ; most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn't news to me . < br / > < br / > Everything changed , though , when I got to the end of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank . The emotional impact of seeing this footage , only a second or so long , made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary ; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me , more personal . I'd always been moved by her story , but when I saw that footage , what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life . ( I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank , and I'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television , but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience . It's not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone . ) < br / > < br / > I realize now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank ; it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance . I think to myself , " How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank ? " This being the case , though , ANNE FRANK : REMEMBERED , along with reading her diary , is the best place to start . It's a story that everyone should know .
I was really excited when I read " The Canterville Ghost " would be shown on TV . However , I was deeply disappointed . I loved the original story written by Oscar Wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie .
Just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film . < br / > < br / > Think of that scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman . Now , remove the pan , add breathing and unshaven men to the mix , and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of Humanity was < br / > < br / > The Inspector is a true dolt , not even a dolt , just a dim witted , slow moving simpleton . How they ever solved a crime is beyond me . < br / > < br / > Obligatory sex scenes are awful , and gratitious . < br / > < br / > Eventual villain of the piece ( he raped and killed an 11 year old girl ) is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted . < br / > < br / > Uninspiring camera work . < br / > < br / > The director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings . I assume he also meant provide their own dialogue ( there is bugger all - adding to its boredom level ) , inventive camera work ( just static shots , totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in ) and plot ! < br / > < br / > Truly awful . < br / > < br / > 0 out of 10 .
Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease , making most of his peers green with envy . While his performance in " Save The Tiger " is Oscar-worthy , I feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other , better roles that had preceded this current one . < br / > < br / > This is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast , or in this case , one particular member . It's too bad the screenwriter's output didn't match that of Lemmon's . Don't waste your time with this one .
Breaker ! Breaker ! has Chuck Norris as a truck driver and a karate master , talk about juggling two disparate careers . He gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother Michael Augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up , Chuck goes looking for him . < br / > < br / > What young Augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by Judge George Murdock who comes from the Roy Bean school of jurisprudence . Of course Norris deals with matters in the usual Chuck Norris way and when he gets in trouble , the call goes out over the CB for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy . This speed-trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal . < br / > < br / > Chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one . He's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the Academy won't be looking at this gobbler . George Murdock is overacting outrageously as the Judge Roy Bean wannabe . < br / > < br / > This one is strictly for the fans of Chuck Norris .
Now I myself had previously seen a few episodes of the Leauge Of Gentleman which I found hilarious . When I brought the film I was not sure if I knew enough about the series to get it , boy was I wrong . This is one of the best comedy films I have seen ever and the clever acting of the Leauge makes the film . It has a very good and funny plot as well as using only a few characters at any one time helps because it doesn't make it too confusing which would have wrecked the film . Even If you have never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this film it will make you laugh and this is a film that can be watched more then once and is an excellent film to watch with your mates . It truly deserves it review a definite 10 out of 10 .
A wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff . Based on a true story , one of the many " small " stories prior to WW II , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures , impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes , with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon . Viewed at the Stony Brook Film festival , the film was enthusiastically received . Well written and expertly cast . The characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations .
Yeah , there's a " sleeper " watching Sleeper Cell and it was me . After reading comparisons to " 24 " ( like on the cover of the DVD ) , I expected a fast-paced action romp . But nope ... this series just putts along . In my groggy half-awake state I would think , " He's gonna ... " and , poof , it would happen ... " Guess that van is gonna roll off the ... " and there she goes . < br / > < br / > And so on . < br / > < br / > And why would Darwyn , in extra-deep cover , pursue a babe ? Could it be , perhaps , to provide a little T & A ? Hey , that works for me , hence four stars rather than three . < br / > < br / > This show is no " 24 " . I've watched " 24 " . Sleeper Cell , you're no " 24 " .
I understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and I am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible . I've been to the Scottish highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the characters disappointing . This plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground . I feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant . If you want a silent movie that captures that presence try ( Le Dernier Combat ) . There have been very few movies that I couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them . Absolute dribble !
Well acted , yes . Very well , I must say , even though I don't speak Chezck . Nice cinematography . But the script is lame , really lame . A predictable soap opera , in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen . OK , maybe the ending isn't as predictable , but is it any good ? It is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already , and forget about the day after . < br / > < br / > I just got a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough . That's really sad , because I have no idea of what else to say about this movie , which actually says a a lot about it , don't you think ? The thing is .. . It has no soul and no originality . Compare this movie with Barrio , or Riff Raff , shot more than ten years ago ( or the extraordinary recently shot The Child ) . It's sad to see that this is a much worse film .
I believe , that this is a heart tugging film . Richard Donner ( Directed the top grossing film " Superman " ) , had done a great job directing this film . Some of the segemets were good , and several were horrible because , Bobby ( Mazzello ) was beatened by The King ( Baldwin , and especially their dog , Shane attacked the King which meant that he paid for what he had done to Bobby . < br / > < br / > Elijah Wood , portrayed a good role in this film . The memorable scene in this , he dreamt that he took the buffalo's advice about Bobby being battered . Lorraine Bracco , ( Pre-Soprano ) had portrayed an impressing role . < br / > < br / > I give this film * * * out of four ! ! !
Normally for movie reviews , I try to be constructive and objective , but there is only one word for this , uh , " film " : SUCKS ! ! ! The dialogue , acting , special effects , plot , set , and characters all seem as if they were made up by , well , my potted plants . Don't see this , for the sake of all that is good and right in this world ! :)
This is one incredibly standard western , that features some bad acting , dull storyline and silly action . < br / > < br / > Biggest problem perhaps is how incredibly formulaic this movie is . It features all of the usual clichés , yes even a bar fight and the movie really doesn't has any surprises in it . It makes this a dull and a weak western to watch , also not in the least because it's such a poorly made one . < br / > < br / > It's obviously a small production and the movie looks like it got shot in 30 days . The directing and editing can be called bad and all of the action sequences featured in the movie are incredibly silly . It perhaps almost becomes a bit humorous to watch , for all the wrong reasons . < br / > < br / > Its story also isn't that interesting . It's a pretty friendly western ( so also no blood ) , in which for some odd reason everybody seems to be against the Younger brothers , who in this movie are being portrayed as good and very friendly guys . The story gets sillier and sillier as it heads toward its ending . The Younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger gang , of which the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part of . Of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie . It just was custom for an early ' 40 ' s to have likable man characters in it . It wasn't really until the Spagethi-western age really that the main characters became rotten criminals themselves really . Strangely enough that approached has always worked out better than those early western's in which the main character is on the good side of the law . < br / > < br / > Thing that does make this movie original is the fact that it was shot in color . This was something pretty unique for an ' 40 ' s western and still gives the movie something extra . You can wonder though , why they shot this western in full color . The movie is still done in the style of a black & white early western after all and I actually believe that this movie would had been a bit more credible if it got done in black & white instead . < br / > < br / > You could easily do without this western . < br / > < br / > 4/10
Recap : A lone swordsman , living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen , recollects how his life turned out to be as it is . It started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead , causing him to leave his home town . One of the swordsmen is Huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story , where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister . But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have Huang protected , and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person . < br / > < br / > Comments : I've seen the Redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 . How the two versions differ I can't say , but the Redux is very heavily stylized in the way of Chinese Wuxia action . That is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie . A comprehensible story . But true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong . Therefore there are lots of colorful , very beautiful scenes , that are completely unrelated to the story . < br / > < br / > The editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled . Much is left out in the scenes , the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way . Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights , only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated . The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie . < br / > < br / > Thanks to these brutal but very few fights , the movie is put into the action genre . The poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing . Only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action , the other couldn't be farther away from it . The movie in its entirety is very slow , dull and hence very boring . Not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie . < br / > < br / > I might say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style , since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems , most importantly that the visual is more important than the story , but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen . < br / > < br / > 3/10
Plot Synopsis : Los Angeles in the future . Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers , android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty . Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss , Senator Robert Dilly ( the man who set up the USCJS ) , by the Union for Human Rights , a group of anti-machine activists . Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood . Dilly sends Core Trackers after him . Phillips joins the UHR group & helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly . < br / > < br / > " Cyber Tracker " is the first of a number of sci-fi / action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin , co-founder of PM Entertainment , a powerhouse of action films during the 1990s . Other Pepin films include " Hologram Man " , " T-Force " , " The Silencers " & " Dark Breed " . Pepin films typically start with a major action sequence which lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick in . The script for this film has a few plot holes  it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop actually is . As for the acting , Don " The Dragon " Wilson may be tough but cannot act for beans , with little charisma . His co-stars are a lot better . The film's best bet are the action scenes , which throw up some impressive artillery fire , a huge bodycount & not one but three moments where a vehicle flies through the air , flips & hits the ground , exploding . The visual effects border on the cheap side & the musical score is low-key & shrill .
The first time I saw this film I was a kid . I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV . I remember watching it alone and crying afterward . It was only the second film to illicit that response ( Rocky was the first ) and there haven't been many since . I can't say why exactly ; Larry " Rain " Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else . I know I admired Murphy , not so much for what he did , but for the way he did his time . Stoic . He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity . He ran because he could . He needed no other reason . I have a rule today , that when I see this film late at night on cable television ( the only time most will come across it ) I must watch , no matter what I have to do the next morning . Fortunately it doesn't play often like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites , so I still get plenty of sleep and I never tire of the story of one man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory .
Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof . Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir , but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right . The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects . The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through . The infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny . I sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art mundanacity . Everything is this movie is alive and breathing , dripping with desperate longing to be simultaneously loved and reviled . It works . < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10
36/100 . This is not to be confused with the decent Arachnophobia , this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie . This one is so bad , it actually does have some entertainment value on that level . There are numerous unintended ( I think ) laugh out loud scenes . I wasn't expecting much from the film , and it was actually worse than I had imagined it would be . < br / > < br / > It's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess . Fortunately , it doesn't take itself too seriously . The acting , as expected , is not quite Oscar caliber . The special effects are poor , worse than I would have thought they would be . Poorly edited and the score is intrusive .
This was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film . The costuming , the music , the cinematography - all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience . < br / > < br / > Ted Danson , best know for his TV roles in " Cheers " and " becker , " was excellent in the role of Gulliver . Mary Steenburgen ( Time After Time , Cross Creek ) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife . < br / > < br / > Other performances I really enjoyed were James Fox as Dr . Bates , Alfre Woodard as the Queen of Brobdingnag , and Peter O'Toole as the Emperor of Lilliput . < br / > < br / > This would make an enjoyable children's film , but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary .
first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire . we both thought it was a top film , then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub 1v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on , and also there is a fifth in the pipe line . if no one has seen the movies . these are the best of the best . i think it deserver's a thousands Oscar's . i could watch these from morning to night . i would love to have a set of nails like he has , watch out girls . i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film . these ant typical vampire movies they are better . i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films . it would make all my dreams come true
I won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film ; I'll try to add a few new points . The Coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the Blondie song " No Exit " in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire ( it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song ) . Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more handsome . And really what does anyone go to a Brad Pitt movie for other than eye candy ? Same here , although this is poorly filmed ( check out " Starship Troopers " instead ) . And of course Udo Kier , after having played Dracula in the Morrissey / Warhol film , has little more than a cameo . Enjoy it if you can .
Watch this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan say " I love you , K-k-Kiran ... " It's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this , from the beginning to the end . This movie made him famous , and I totally recommend it :D It's highly entertaining , the music's wicked and you will laugh right along with Shahrukh here ... You'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters . You will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time . Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in . And after you see the movie , have the songs and scenery playing in your mind ... forever .
May contain spoilers < br / > < br / > This historical movie was so refreshing . Although it may be exagerating the actual events , it does show the heartless nature of emperor Qui , which he was later infamous for . And there wasn't a single computer generated person in it . I think it's great that China has produce such an epic film . The costumes and the settings were beautiful , the performances were also excellent . Dignity vs . death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the Chinese history and culture . I also enjoyed a little allusion to the terracotta warriors , a 3d map carved of the conquest of China with individual soldiers . Emperor Qui of course later as entombed with his life size terracotta warriors . < br / > < br / > I also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf , he was a very interesting character , even if he only had a small scene . < br / > < br / > 9/10 < br / > < br / >
This is a piece of Hollywood product that should have never left a film can . Dialogue without a plausible thought , plot without a point , staging without skill , directing without direction , and acting without the worth of some backwater high school's freshman class play . The entire cast should have been arrested for over acting . < br / > < br / > But otherwise , okay !
The Beauty . The Terror . The Poetry . The Horror . The Innocence . The Guilt . < br / > < br / > Maybe that's just about all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS . The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it . I myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when I went into this movie . I just took a look at the nice cover-art , didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into DVD-player . I only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended . < br / > < br / > The DVD-cover read " The Most Frightening Film since THE RING , THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER " . Though the frightening-part might be right , you can forget about the rest , because the only thing A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those movie is ... a ghostly apparition with long black hair . It's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous Japanese movies , because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others . < br / > < br / > This movie simply is a small masterpiece , and here are some reasons ( without telling anything about the plot ): The movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise-twists . And just when you think you've had the conclusion ( whether you get it or not , that's irrelevant for the moment ) and you think the movie will end ... this movie goes on a bit longer . The cinematography is amazing , using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night . The camera-work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive , if not , innovating angles . Some shots are pure poetry ( e . g . the top-shot with the two sisters at the lake ) . It all looks very stylish . There are only four main characters , but the intrigue surrounding them is intense . The story itself starts a bit slow , but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting . There was even one scene ( when the girls took off towards the lake ) that suddenly had me remembering Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES . But when the horror kicks in , it's quite effective . There are also a few successful surprise-scares in it . Damn , I jumped right up from my sofa . The musical score is great , and at times when it's not supposed to be scary , I couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an Italian feeling to it . A bit strange for a Korean movie . But nevertheless , a great score . So much care went into every detail of this film , including a perfectly balanced surround sound . < br / > < br / > I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit . It's more a mysterious horror-drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level . No matter how you look at it , this is Asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest . It might not be gory , but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed . So if you haven't seen it yet , then find a copy , pop it into your DVD-player , go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time . < br / > < br / > There , I hope I did a good job praising it without spoiling anything .
This outlandish Troma movie is actually a very good movie . It is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production . Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore . Troma has made some very good gore films , one of my favorites is " Street Trash " and of course the Toxic Avenger movies . I have one Troma movie , " Terror Firmer " , which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie . I enjoyed " Tromeo and Juliet " so much , that I need to finally watch " Terror Firmer " . This is a 2 - disc Collector's version with four commentaries and many many features . " Tromeo and Juliet " is an absolute hoot and highly recommended .
Excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten . Unfortunately , times haven't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom-conscious Americans to see .
Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film " experts . " it is low budget , but fun , and the leading lady is very sexy . I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph . Good viewing fun . I bought the DVD and enjoyed it . The special effects are stop motion animation , and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today . I always enjoy Brett Piper movies , and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me , Screaming Dead and anything else he has done . I look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of Ms . Joseph . I simply cannot see why this woman hasn't been in more movies , as her acting is excellent .
Like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down , so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity . Donna Reed is a case in point . < br / > < br / > I don't think Donna Reed ever thought that Donna Stone was anything challenging , not to a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here to Eternity . She was certainly better prepared to play wife , mother , and homemaker Donna Stone after having played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life . < br / > < br / > Donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband . Carl Betz was not an idiot , he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house . Talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis . < br / > < br / > Though this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband at the time , Tony Owen produced it . Yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children , Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen . Fabares had that best selling teen record Johnny Angel which she introduced on the show . She successfully made the transition to adult star , most known for her role in Coach as Craig T . Nelson's wife . < br / > < br / > But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day . The Donna Reed Show dare I say got most of its viewers because of him . It's forgotten now , but Petersen also had a best selling record , My Dad . Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel . < br / > < br / > Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself . So many of them end so tragically , it's good work that he's doing . < br / > < br / > The Stone family was the quintessence of Middle America . They lived in a suburb near Chicago , they led wholesome lives . Mom and Dad were always there for the kids . Of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew . < br / > < br / > It's this series I believe was the model for the TV town of Pleasantville where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked into . < br / > < br / > I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show . Easy to take , but not too seriously .
A 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across America to find Motorama cards , which is a gas station card game , that if he can find to spell out " Motorama " he has a chance to win 500 million dollars . He meets many bizarre characters along the way . No one can make an ' instant cult classic ' , Joe Minion's previous " After Hours " achieved that by sheer merit & an amazing director , but it wasn't instant . This movie , on the other hand , is just bizarre just to be bizarre . No rhyme or reason to any of it . The plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos . It's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one . It's way too slapped together . I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch films . That's damn near heresy as even Lynch's ' worst ' film ( worst in quotes , as he doesn't have an bad films really ) is still miles above this dreck . < br / > < br / > Eye Candy : Cynthia King is topless very briefly < br / > < br / > DVD Extras : Trailer for " Joe Dirt '
This was one of the worst movies that I have ever watched . The story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander . All the story was about was having sex over and over again . There was no need for all of this footage - only to create a soft porn film . Of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes . I don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie - except I assume to get men to watch it . I gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower . Don't waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t & a . The creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver . Poor excuse for entertainment .
I thought this movie was really awesome ! One of Drew's best . I am also a fan of Michael Vartan so I thought he was so hot in this movie . Why all the bad reviews . I would want to watch this movie over and over again if I could . I also loved the ending . This movie clearly has shown a smile on my face ! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it . I love them both so I also highlighted this movie . At the end , when Drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in High School . Again , the movie was amazing . Defiantly a 10/10 . Hope this comment was very useful to any IMDb readers .
I've watched many short films in my day . Often I find them either too compressed ( throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run ) , too " artsy " , or lacking a clear-cut vision . I can say none of these things about Starcrossed . In this review , I'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers , but I'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest . < br / > < br / > As with any short film , the story is fairly simple , straightforward and easy to digest . It's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society's most deeply held taboos . This film succeeds in every respect . In the fifteen minutes of running time , I found myself feeling a gamut of emotions . With only a little dialog , the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers . < br / > < br / > From the opening scene set in their early childhood , one can see the very close relationship the brothers have . When the film progresses to the present day in the next scene , the excellent acting and honest , heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way . As the relationship progresses , any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution . And the aftermath of that resolution is heart-rending . < br / > < br / > Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message . If nothing else , it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shame-filled and secretive taboo of incest . Though the film is only fifteen minutes long , it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll . This is perhaps my favorite short film I've ever seen . I can't recommend it highly enough .
The St . Francisville Experiment claims " this ain't no walk in the woods " , a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch . Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion , The St . Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience . One must say , however , that this is destined to be a camp classic . < br / > < br / > Warning : Spoiler is forthcoming ! ! < br / > < br / > I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's " paranormal consultant " Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie . Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information , stop reading here . For those of you who can't resist , read on my friends and all shall be told . < br / > < br / > Mr . Taylor , a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true , informed the audience at this video screening that The St . Francisville Experiment was not a documentary . Shock ! Amazing ! As if we didn't know ... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers . Matter of fact , he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana , but rather in California . All four participants were true actors ( notice I didn't say good ... ) . One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER . < br / > < br / > What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true . It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax . The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant . Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as " surround yourself with the white light " and " I love the ghosts " , The St . Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle , boo , jeer and chant " I love the ghosts ! " < br / > < br / > Talk about false advertising . True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house . From the bug in the sandwich ( ooh ... scary ... ) to the annoying Madison , from the " seance " which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed , The St . Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie . Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be : < br / > < br / > " The St . Francisville Experiment : A comedic look at how not to make a movie " .
Worst movie ever ! ! Its not clever or funny or thought provoking . 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script . < br / > < br / > Acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing . < br / > < br / > Maybe the writer / director combination believed they were Quentin Tarantino or something ( you know make a movie about nothing still cool ) but failed miserably . < br / > < br / > I hope the writer never makes another movie EVER ! ! not everyone is born a writer , sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever . < br / > < br / > Please don't watch this movie , even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins .
` Shadow Magic ' recaptures the joy and amazement of the first movie audiences . It also shows the power of film in its ability to bring the world a little closer , overcome cultural barriers and to preserve ourselves for generations yet to come . Certainly , anyone who truly loves the art of the motion picture will enjoy this film . It's a great first effort by writer / director Ann Hu , who will hopefully have many films to follow .
I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002 . This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival , however , as it turned out , all the more interesting . < br / > < br / > The story , of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction , is based on actual facts . Moreover , the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again , this time for the film , which is partly set up as a stage play . Not only do they all happen to be good actors , Jia Hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well , the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective . < br / > < br / > Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties . Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River . In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive , except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso . < br / > < br / > I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs . We really feel the pain and struggle Jia is in . At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him . < br / > < br / > The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be caught in , dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him . Because there are personal ' interviews ' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well . < br / > < br / > The film has a heavy feel , but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone . So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film . The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after . This is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film this is a strong recommendation .
Warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel Michael as a brawling , overweight , cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex . He does have a good side , however , as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven . Funny , well played out film ; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent .
If you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie ( bad in the way only Ken Russell at his worst can be ) , you must try this one . It succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a . 25 porn-booth , and you can just about smell the urine on the floor . Kathleen Turner struts around in a blond wig , getting her kicks from " pretending " to be a two-bit hooker ( she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect ) , and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical " priest " who is out to maybe murderer her ( yet another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in drag ) . Annie Potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit , which is reason enough to hate this movie . The kinky will love the sex scenes , so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner give a cop a taste of his billy club ( I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing ) .
totally genius film from the CKY crew ... ( not the jackass boys ... johnny knoxville , chris pontius , steve-o etc are not in this < br / > < br / > film ) . OK so maybe they'r not the best actors but its not what you call a serious film ... but hey there havin fun and its totally funny to watch . who doesn't want to see don vito dressed as a roman emperor ! < br / > < br / > a total must if you like viva la bam or CKY ... an amazing soundtrack provided by the almighty HIM , CKY and others ... check out the extra features on the DVD especially Bran's freestyle < br / > < br / > Chinese rap number two ... seriously hilarious ... check this film out ... you wont regret it ... 10/10
" The belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure which exists in the Real is the most succinct definition of paranoia . "  Slavoj Zizek < br / > < br / > This is a review of " Marathon Man " and " The Falcon and the Snowman " , two films by director John Schlesinger . < br / > < br / > Though Hitchcock and Lang brought the " conspiracy thriller " to Hollywood , the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s , with films like " The Parallax View " , " Z " , " Marathon Man " , " Capricorn One " , " The Manchurian Candidate " , " Three Days of the Condor " and " All The President's Men " . This was the age of Vietnam and Watergate , the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders . < br / > < br / > The genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s , until the " X Files " TV series sprung to life . With taglines such as " The Truth Is Out There " and " Trust No One " , the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots , the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes . The only way out of the maze ? " Fight the future ! " as the tagline of the series ' final season proclaimed . It was apparently our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information , discovering some elusive " truth " that ensured our own freedom . < br / > < br / > This trend ended with the boom of the internet , conspiracy thrillers now giving way to " conspiracy documentaries " . The internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as " Loose Change " and " Zeitgeist " , whilst in the mainstream Michael Moore titillated his audience with stuff like " Fahrenheit 9/11 " . All these documentaries believed in a " secret order " , a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world . They struggle to create a mono-myth , linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single , all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything . < br / > < br / > This need to " streamline narratives " , to make them more " efficient " , is reflected in the scientific community , who battle to create a " Grand Unification Theory " and ultimately a " Theory of Everything " , merging everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into one giant all encompassing formula . < br / > < br / > So ultimately , the " conspiracy thriller " is rooted in man's desire to have control . The modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions , yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies ( an unseen Other pulling the strings ) . This apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big Other . Its disappearance causes us to construct an Other of the Other ( conspiracy ) in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes . Conversely , there is no need to take the Big Other seriously if we believe in an Other of the Other . We're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures . < br / > < br / > Man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe , to create a kind of paternal babysitter ( be it God , a mathematical formula , a conspiracy theory , an explanation for violence / conspiracies / murder / war etc ) who provides meaning and symbolic order . The Big Other provides reassurances to the believer . It's a " lifestyle choice " , akin to religion , in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality . < br / > < br / > The problem with most " conspiracy thrillers " , from the innocent days of Hitchcock's " Topaz " all the way up to modern fare like " The Da Vinci Code " , are two fold . Firstly , they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is " wrong " amongst the " elite " or " best people " , but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social , collective and systemic , an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures . Secondly , and most importantly , these " conspiracies " ignore the fact that the Big Other simply doesn't exist . There is no symbolic order pulling the strings . < br / > < br / > Some modern " conspiracy thrillers " ( " Eyes Wide Shut " , " Existenz " etc ) acknowledge this , with their untangleable webs of lies , accidents , truths and half truths , nothing ever adding up , nothing ever making sense , the real and the hyperreal , the truth and the desire , all blurred , without any identifiable ground zero , but these are mostly films by intellectual directors . < br / > < br / > Compared to these modern " conspiracy thrillers " , " Marathon Man " and " The Falcon and the Snowman " are positively archaic . " Marathon Man " is a about a grad student ( Dustin Hoffman ) who gets embroiled in his big brother's business ( Roy Scheider ) , which unfortunately has to do with spies , guns , double agents , diamonds and evil Nazi dentists . Scheider is suave , Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals ( the reveal of the Eiffel tower is stunning ) , but what's most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don't intersect until the 1 hour mark . Even then , it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense . Unfortunately , the film ends with a clichéd showdown between the villain and the good guy , everything neatly resolved and explained . < br / > < br / > " The Falcon and the Snowman " is a bit more ambitious . Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union . Hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of Penn , a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the KGB . Penn does this strictly for the money , whilst Hutton is disillusioned with the American government ( particularly its attempt to depose the leader of Australia ) and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage . In other words , the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies . < br / > < br / > " Marathon Man "  7.9 / 10 < br / > < br / > " The Falcon and the Snowman "  8/ 10 < br / > < br / > Aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clichéd ending , " Marathon Man " is an effective thriller , with several neat scenes . " The Falcon and the Snowman " is even better , Penn turning in a memorable performance .
I vowed some time ago to never get another Joe Castro film ( perhaps after " Near Death " ) but I sort of ended up with this one by accident , since it was a Troma release & I didn't read the cover carefully . Oops . Well , I watched it , and it's by no means good , but it's , I guess , sort of " tongue in cheek " ... if it's not , it sure seemed that way . Some intrepid folks from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find if the Chupacabra exists , because of surveillance camera footage from someone's GOAT BARN that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision . And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition . There's a couple of camera men , one of whom whines the whole time , and there some ex-Marine named " Army " ( ? ! ) , who is some kind of munitions expert or something . At any rate , the do find the Chupacabra on some guy's ranch & set out to find it , getting involved with two supposed witches along the way . The creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking , with spines on its back & a great big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for . Eventually , after a bunch of folks done get killed , so does the Chupacabra , and they take it back to the university for an autopsy . So , is it from another planet ? Is it a genetic creation from some lab in Puerto Rico ? Uh , they don't tell us , really . Not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either . Definitely not a wide audience for this one . 4 out of 10 .
Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time.Both Aamir and Salman khan have acted brilliantly while Aamir's acting was far better than salman.Aamir Khan is known as ' MR . PERFECTIONIST ' in Bollywood and he proves it in every of his film . < br / > < br / > The story moves around two young guys Amar ( Aamir Khan ) and Prem ( Salman Khan ) both are from poor families and are a big dreamer.They want to become rich without bearing any pain.so when they hear about Raveena Bajaj ( Raveena Tandon ) daughter of Mr.Bajaj ( Paresh Rawal ) who comes to India to find his bridegroom , they both fool their fathers to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins.There is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny.Paresh Rawal is in double role ( Teja and Mr . Bajaj ) and has acted brilliantly as he always does.Shakti kapoor ( crime master Gogo ) also adds a great comedy . < br / > < br / > This movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of Bollywood .
Wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen . < br / > < br / > The shift from the early days as a New-York based black-American phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture ( and largely West Coast-based ) is profiled well . < br / > < br / > The humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument , but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex . These DJs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity , rhythm and timing , among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables . < br / > < br / > DJ Qbert's comment that he pictures what " music " must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out , seemingly silly at first , makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create ! < br / > < br / > Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain ' stars ' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture . One film at a time people !
This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable . Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser , which is exactly how it turned out . < br / > < br / > Kelly plays Danny McGuire , a nightclub owner in Brooklyn ( Brooklyn is always the " wrong side of the tracks " in ' 40s films ) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) . Rita is lovely , and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother . Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair ( Otto Kruger ) , who romanced and lost Rusty's grandmother . < br / > < br / > The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose , to the detriment of his club , because she has a chance at success that he can't give her . But , naturally , that's not what Rusty ultimately wants , because , as usual in films of that time , the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind . There are no surprises , but everybody does their thing well . < br / > < br / > Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances , this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window . He was the master at that sort of dance , and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once . The melodrama gets a bit thick , and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two , but Kelly takes this film to the next level . This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good . An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air . < br / > < br / > Kelly's character in the 1980 " Xanadu " also was named Danny McGuire . This film was the beginning , that film the end , of a terrific run for a dancing genius . Clearly , this film meant a lot to him . Highly recommended .
Rugged David Innes ( solid Doug McClure ) and doddery Dr . Abner Perry ( a delightfully dotty Peter Cushing ) drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine . The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men . Director Kevin Conner , working from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky , maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness , thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure . The lovably hokey ( not so ) special effects are quite ( unintentionally ) funny . The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting : cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men , equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes , and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good . One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile . Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws . Moreover , we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt . It's a total treat to see Cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely , but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick . The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as the fetching Princess Dia , plus there are nice supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah . Mike Vickers ' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff . Alan Hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings . A complete campy riot .
Hmmm - cheerleader massacre . Let me think - high school girls get sliced up , except the cute one survives . Got it . Next movie . < br / > < br / > I was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 . I really thought they quit making these movies in the 80 ' s . This was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy , dumb male horn dogs , even dumber male adult , and hot teacher . It continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods . We have seen it all before . < br / > < br / > However this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me-too slashers , so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse .
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer , I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar . Then I remembered - - Intro Psych 101 Lecture ! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement , basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention , as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure . Alice's first encounter is being bathed , with emphasis on the genitals and bottom . Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's dingaling . I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's encounters , but I do remember how well they matched . It's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it , rather than the cliche " I'm here to deliver your pizza . Let's screw . " < br / > < br / > I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be wrecked by this film , as it was her first film . And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released , but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell . When Meese was staging his anti-pornography commission ( to distract people from his own criminal activities ) , Meese hired the services of an anti-porn activist named Judith Reisner . Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography . She saw the " Alice " cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old . Yeah , right ...
In the early 00 ' s , production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre movies in France after " The Crimson Rivers " and " Brotherhood of the Wolf " turned out to be hits , so several movies were green-lit or saved from their " direct-to-video " fate . However , France , as opposed to the US , UK or Italy , has little tradition of fantasy B-movies and it turned out quickly that " Samouraïs " , " Bloody Mallory " or the " Crimson Rivers " sequel were ill-advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in French cinema in the first place . As they flopped , producers have gone back to their usual fare : derivative farces or the umpteenth self-referential tribute to French New Wave by a former critic from " Les Cahiers du cinéma " . < br / > < br / > " Brocéliande " could only have been green-lit during this short window , as it serves no other discernible purpose . It's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters , a French University looking like a US campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before , even before the movie started . < br / > < br / > These elements make all the fun of a 70 ' s or a 80 ' s B-movie and you expect them in a 70 ' s or 80 ' s movie . However , we're not in the 80 ' s anymore and nobody warned director Doug Headline , as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie . Headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80 ' s but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes " Brocéliande " a bore . < br / > < br / > When you put together clichés from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino , you get a " Scream " or a " Death Proof " , movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichés and add a great deal to them . That's called " talent " and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago . < br / > < br / > " Brocéliande " takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies ( unfortunately for the male viewer , the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing ) . There are very strong similarities ( presumably unintentional ) between the plot of " Brocéliande " and the reviled " Halloween 3 : Season Of The Witch " , as both deal with supernatural Druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on Halloween night . As even the plot of " Halloween 3 " makes more sense than this one , it means that something seriously wrong went with " Brocéliande " .
A very great movie . < br / > < br / > A big love story . Lots of sword fighting . Huge battle scenes . Heros and villains . Real history . < br / > < br / > Few in the West know much Chinese history . Chin Zchaundi founded China . The country is in fact named after him . Some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed . This is a historical epic of how he ended the Period of Contending States and unified China . He founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since . < br / > < br / > Chin ( or the King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire ) was roughly contemporaneous with Scipio , Hannibal , and Fabius in the West . The parallel Roman world dominance ( West and East worlds ) was achieved without a single towering personality like Chin . It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar - the nearest comparable Western figure . < br / > < br / > Chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot . History only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film . The famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be . Gong Li is lovely . She is the emotional core of the story . It all makes for great movie making .
This excruciatingly boring and unfunny movie made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler , as only someone as evil as him could torture people with this tripe . I saw this movie remastered , which only made the suffering inflicted by this atrocity more severe . This movie is nothing but a pathetic , repetitive movie , which instead of inducing two hours of laughter , it induced two hours of suicidal urges . After the first 10 minutes of this , I began wishing that gas would start seeping from the speakers of the theatre . < br / > < br / > If I could give it a zero out of ten I would happily do so . Avoid at all costs !
The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune to < br / > < br / > rent . Unwatchable . Much of the movie is obviously improvised , < br / > < br / > and not well . It looks like Toback took the first take of < br / > < br / > everything . The movie gets good for a couple of minutes when < br / > < br / > Robert Downey Jr . shows up , then goes to hell again real < br / > < br / > quickly .
I cannot understand why so many people did not like this film . Robert De Niro was on top of his game , delivering his lines with such aplomb , one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor . Granted , the film seemed to take on many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept , it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny . From the police dog , to the fact Eddie Murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me , this film is a real keeper . Rene Russo also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly , establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy .
Largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects - - the " claw " in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to kill himself . I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell you who was in it . That's a bad sign . I'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen ... and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower . Basically I should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words " produced by Sam Katzman " came on the screen if I knew what was good for me , but then I sat through " Harum Scarum " also so I guess I deserve it .
Chris Morris ' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints , both from the audience and from the people taking part . But , nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this . The 2001 Brass Eye Special . Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived , the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired . < br / > < br / > The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable ! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program ! The subject that the program handled turned many heads , but the message was widely misinterpreted . The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program . This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia . The show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject . Morris , is and always will be , a media satirist . The notion that the program ' makes fun ' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable ! Morris never attempts to do either such thing . He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming , and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject . < br / > < br / > Using many of his established ' Brass Eye ' characters , such as , Ted Maul and others , Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up , and the result is as funny , if not funnier , than anything Morris has done previously . Using his tried and tested formula , Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary . In actuality , they are made to look like exactly what they are . Retards . < br / > < br / > All in all , the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed . And , with one opening line , Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001 : " Welcome to Paedo-Gedden ! "
Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's Batman . Which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie . Like the Breathtaker being a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader , that's kind of cool . The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter . The Cormen B-movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing . There are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy . This movie , the good out weighs the bad . But if you aren't one for comic book movies , then I would advise not watching Black Scorpion , however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before . Then check out BLACK SCORPION , as for me I give it 8 STARS .
Well , how to start ? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it . Now I do . < br / > < br / > After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics . Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls . No wonder . They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs " AWESOME " . < br / > < br / > Other than that this film is completely predictable , the actors are mainly forever B-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly , the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this : it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel ! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist . All in all , lots of noise about nothing . < br / > < br / > I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before . Apart from Donald Sutherland's " look , I'm here too " appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a " pass if you're above 18 " all over it .
This is a tough film to review , since several factors need to be taken into account . Let's filter the more judgmental .. Ok , are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer ? Can you withstand an independent , low-budget film ? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look ? Well , if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one . This film is an almost 100 % accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree , and is styled as an autobiography . It isn't a glamorized , unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film " Dahmer " ( 2001 ) was . The movie begins with Dahmer , played quite convincingly by Carl Crew , sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment . His thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past-tense , narrated style that accurately explains much of Dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times . We get to know the character , both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life . It isn't anyone's fault but Dahmer's that 17 people died , but being a criminal psychology student , I was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented , truthfully , in this film . You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship , but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers . It should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence , with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain . You do see two deaths that I remember , one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid . While you don't see anything graphic , this cruelty and the convincing acting of both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene . And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low , you will see the results . There is a prop hand and head or two , but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive . Besides , these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible . Although acceptable , they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing . The film actually concludes before Dahmer's death in 1994 , due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior . That's about the only big difference from the real story , and the information that remains is , as I've stated , very true to the facts . The film quality could be better , the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet , and the acting of several characters IS a bit hammy , but it's not overboard . In my opinion , this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of America's most remembered serial killers . I think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well , and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner , aided by a thoroughly excellent Carl Crew as Dahmer .
This was an attempt toward a romantic comedy , and one which did not work . Although the film was cast in an interesting manner , the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all . The director's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view . It was embarrassing to watch William Baldwin and , in particular , Armin Muller-Stahl .
Doug McClure has starred in a few of these British produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot . I know THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values . That's the problem with this movie - The production values go way beyond " So bad they're good " affectionate territory and become " so bad I think I'll go and see what's on the other channels " < br / > < br / > One case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid Cushing and McClure encountering a monster . It's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection . It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot . Have I mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces ? No really this looks like it was filmed in somebody's living room with the spare change left over from that year's DOCTOR WHO budget . Even former DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line " You can't mesmerise me - I'm British " is delivered in a very flat way ( A very similar line is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS ) in a script devoid of characterisation , plotting and memorable dialogue . It's not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it's also infrequent and rare since the monsters don't speak . Wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so that they could explain the plot . Does anyone here know what the plot actually is ? < br / > < br / > A very tedious British movie that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro can not save . The whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops
This unintentionally amusing mid - 80s TV movie is based on the premise that sex bomb Donna Mills ( in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout ) is a neglected housewife , pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader . She escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across , finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side , although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin . < br / > < br / > There are many laughable aspects to this film , Mills ' first foray into co-producing ( later , following her departure from Knots Landing , she found great success as a trashy TV movie queen starring in mostly issue-of-the-week melodramas through most of the ' 90s - she usually played a victim of some sort , clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining conniver she played for so long on Knots ) . Funniest are the drawn-out fantasy sequences , filmed as though they are meant to be soft-core porn ( wind and smoke machines , backlighting , porno music ) , but as this is a network TV movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all . The most amusing ( and bizarre ) scene has Mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky-haired punks ( complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack ) . < br / > < br / > Less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter ( pity poor Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst , or Veronica Cartwright as the mandatory best friend , or even pre-Babs James Brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger . ) < br / > < br / > Of course , as in all of these sorts of films , we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho-therapy and then the film just becomes silly , as we explore , briefly , the reasons for Mills ' " shocking " behaviour ( as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag ! ) < br / > < br / > Vacuous .
The antiwar musical " Hair " is my number one cult-movie . I do not know how many time I have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on VHS , or how many times I have listened the CD with the stunning soundtrack , and now , this masterpiece has been finally released on DVD in Brazil . < br / > < br / > The pacifist and touching story is still amazing , a hymn of freedom , friendship and liberty of choices , and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war . I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70 ' s and their dreams , since the present world is probably worse than in the 70 ' s . I do not recall who won the Oscar in 1979 , but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances . Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager . I have seen " Hair " probably more than twelve times , and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the airplane singing " That's me , that's me , that's me " , and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery . I believe this is one of the most beautiful , sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history . My wife , my daughter and my son also love this film ; therefore I can guarantee that " Hair " is timeless and recommended for any audience . My vote is ten . < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ): " Hair "
Although Flatliners is 15 years old , tonight was my first time ever seeing it . I had heard about the movie Flatliners , but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period . Well , I caught it on one of the premium channels and I must say that it was very good . < br / > < br / > This movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death . They have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him / her back to life . Besides the all-star cast , this movie had some serious bite to it . Just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough , but I really thought the writer & director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view . This was no generic attempt to thrill , frighten , and make one's mind race ... this was the real deal . < br / > < br / > Instead of making it an empty , superficial , star-studded thriller , this movie had substance . A nail-biter , white knuckle , edge-of-the-seat , hard nose thriller . I give it an 8/ 10 .
Some people drift through life , moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye ; others latch on to a cause , another person or a principle and remain adamant , committed to whatever it is - - and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it . But we're all different , ` Made of different clay , ' as one of the characters in this film puts it , which is what makes life so interesting . Some people are just plain crazy , though - - and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses . Who knows ? Who knows what it takes to make things - - life - - work ? Writer / director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it , using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed - - and how one ` gets ' committed - - and obsession , in ` Committed , ' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant , committed , obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy , too . Her name is Joline , and this is her story . < br / > < br / > Admittedly , Joline has always been a committed person ; in work , relationships , in life in general . She's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what . And when she marries Carl ( Luke Wilson ) , it's forever . The only problem is , someone forgot to tell Carl - - and 597 days into the marriage , he's gone ; off to ` find ' himself and figure it all out . When Joline realizes he's not coming back , she refuses to give up on him , or their marriage . Maybe it's because of that ` clay ' she's made of . Regardless , she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him , which she does - - in El Paso , Texas , of all places . But once she knows where he is , she keeps her distance , giving him his ` space ' and not even letting him know she's there . She considers Carl as being in a ` spiritual coma , ' and it's her job to keep a ` spiritual vigil ' over him until he comes to his senses . And while she watches and waits , her life is anything but dull , as she encounters a young woman named Carmen ( Patricia Velazquez ) , a waitress at one of the local eateries ; Carmen's ` Grampy , ' ( Alfonso Arau ) , who is something of a mystic ; T-Bo ( Mark Ruffalo ) , a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl ; and Neil ( Goran Visnjic ) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her . For Joline , it's a journey of discovery , during which she learns a lot about Carl , but even more about herself . < br / > < br / > There's a touch of humor , a touch of romance , and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot . And Krueger presents it all extremely well , delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining . Her characters are very real people , with all the wants , needs and imperfections that make up the human condition ; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story . We see it from Joline's point-of-view , as Krueger makes us privy to Joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations , which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold . That , along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates , makes for a very effective piece of storytelling . There's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter , but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters . And the result is a well textured , affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life . < br / > < br / > Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation . She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable , adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person , and one that is real . And for this film to work , it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable - - and Graham succeeds on all fronts . Her screen presence has never been more alluring , and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes , is enough to draw you in entirely . it's all a part of the character she creates ; there's an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance , who she is inside and out . She's a likable , agreeable person , and because you've shared her innermost thoughts , you know who she is . It's a good job all the way around , beginning with the way the character was written , to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life . < br / > < br / > As Carmen , Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging , as well . Her performance is very natural and straightforward , and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character . She has a charismatic presence , but is less than flamboyant , and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth . She is refreshingly open and up-front ; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back , but is totally honest on all fronts , and that , too , is part of her appeal . And , as with Joline , this character is well written , and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life . < br / > < br / > Overall , there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film , including those of Luke Wilson , Casey Affleck ( as Joline's brother , Jay ) , Goran Visnjic , Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo , who , with very little actual screen time , manages to create a memorable character . < br / > < br / > The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens ( Jenny ) , Clea Du Vall ( Mimi ) , Summer Phoenix ( Meg ) , Art Alexakis ( New York Car Thief ) , Dylan Baker ( Carl's Editor ) , and Mary Kay Place ( Psychiatrist ) . A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture - - reflecting upon who we are , where we're going and what we really need - - ` Committed ' is an enjoyable experience ; a ride definitely worth taking . 8/ 10 .
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who's there to see it reaches its destination , but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero . However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it , but when Monetero tries to get it out of him , he's killed by soldiers . The only clue is that of a medallion , but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed . A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by ( who after the bounty of Monetero ) and offers to save his life for half of the gold . In exchange Monetero gives him half of the medallion , but Clayton notices it and discovers something is up . Soon all three are crossing each other for the gold , but also the bank's insurance company and Monetero's gang are watching on , waiting for their chance to pounce . < br / > < br / > Just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references ( some nicely realised ) from other films ( largely the Dollar trilogy ) of its sub-genre . Director Enzo Castellari's sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight , but there's potential in many of his grand , showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace . Largely there's a lot of tussles , fist-fights ( and plenty of acrobatic stunts ) taking place , compared with all-out vicious shootouts . However most of these stunts are very well done , and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn . The traditional story sticks close to conventional details , but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on , the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three . This leads up to many effective suspenseful moments , clever twists , and plenty of wink , wink . The humour within the starch script is pretty sly . Worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style , is Giovanni Bergamini's dynamically taut framing and Francesco De Masi's impulsively rousing music score . The performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport . George Hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger . Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero . Edd Byrnes gives a poised performance as Clayton , that holds up well . Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do , but is a worthy looker . Gerard Herter , Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide able support . < br / > < br / > A fun and worthy spaghetti parody / homage that throws one curve-ball after another and many fruitful down ' n ' dirty antics .
CAUTION : SPOILERS < br / > < br / > Although this film moved a bit slow at times , the brilliant scenery , richness of the characters and powerful themes make ` Morte a Venezia ' a rewarding experience . I have not read Thomas Mann's book , but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour , musical score , and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice . < br / > < br / > The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions , behaviour and passion . This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i . e . quantifiable--and emotional . This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing ` Fuer Elise ' in lobby of the Hotel and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song . In his flashback , after paying the prostitute , Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions . This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents . < br / > < br / > Ultimately , Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision : stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations ? Or flee Venice to save his own life ? His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay . < br / > < br / > Complimenting the captivating character interaction , Visconti's powerful scenery ( especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon ) renders this film a true masterpiece .
Although this was a film of only less than forty minutes , it is one of best directed and acted stories I have ever seen . It accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90 . < br / > < br / > It is the story of two brothers , one 18 and the other 10 . They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi . Both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of family . < br / > < br / > It brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed , plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind . < br / > < br / > I can fully recommend this film as beyond superb !
Pretty terrible , but not entirely unwatchable . Another review mentioned " predictable " - and that's almost an understatement . You can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be . Every character is either stereotype or archetypical . The good guy in a bad situation , the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline , the repressed , sexually / emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city , engaged to the hotheaded , feeble minded beau from youth , the unredeemable bad guys , two " lost boys " looking for a sense of family - they're all here , and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new . From the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end . The story isn't entirely lame , but direction , acting ( even from a cast with some talent ) everything is thrown together without skill . As to the storyline , we've all seen it before in a movie called " Sister Act . " This is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light . ( As example : the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations ( post office and hardware store ) - yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason . Or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour . The movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement .
I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never actually seen it until last night . I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact . After seeing the movie I am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep . < br / > < br / > The story is pretty preposterous when you think about it . Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their clientèle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing ? They would have all been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say " performance art " . Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching No theater dance thing that she did ? Please . < br / > < br / > It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs . But I didn't buy for a second that THAT girl worked in a steel yard . And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel yard . Steel work is dangerous . You don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb . I love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding . What the hell are they doing in there ? Or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch . She was obviously board and just started cutting random things up . < br / > < br / > But story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way . Flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it , however . < br / > < br / > The dancing horrible . It is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined American musicals until ... well are we really over it yet ? The sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality . I mean I am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib . < br / > < br / > You can't really get behind Alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow . The dog had more going on than she did . < br / > < br / > The love affair is flat . It comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers . Zero passion . < br / > < br / > Even the final scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable . What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleader routine ? In short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts . Oh , yeah , there is a good chunk of nudity when Alex " rescues " her friend from being a useless erotic dancer ( a laughable bit of hypocrisy ) . Other than that the movie is a waste of time . I wish that the MST 3K crew were still in business . This would make good fodder for them .
I was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for Tim Curry , one of my all-time favorite performers . Alas and alack , it is NOT . There doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show , the dialogue is decidedly uninspired , and even the laugh track appeared to be laboring . Brutal .
There is so much not to like about this show it's hard to know where to start . Unlikeable characters , horrible plot lines , terrible writing , AND terrible acting . Don't even get me started on the obnoxious theme music . < br / > < br / > On top of all that the show is out of touch with U . S . audiences due to the heavy Canadian references all throughout it . " Oh say Derek , will you be going to Queens College in the Fall ! How have you bean ? We should go oot . " < br / > < br / > Granted , other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate : Atlantis , but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances ( like Rodney calling a Z-P-M a " Zed-P-M " ) the show didn't focus on life in Canada . < br / > < br / > MTV is running Degrassi ( another show based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager ) during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time ( most teens are at school when it airs ) . I'd wager it's for the same reason . Shows that focus on teenage life in Canada don't translate well to a U . S . audience . < br / > < br / > This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace .
Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu ( The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya ) might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy / drama . Well , it's not ! The setting just happen to be a school environment . This is a comedy alright , but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm . And the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman . The episodes is aired , as it seems , out of order , i . e . the pilot is in fact episode 11 . This makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes . The show is an adaption of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series about Haruhi Suzumiya . < br / > < br / > What about the story then ? Like in all the episodes does the story revolves Haruhi Suzumiya , who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures . Haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans , and actively searches for aliens , time travelers and espers ( persons with supernatural forces ) . To find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the SOS-Brigade ( Save the world by Overloading it with fun : Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade ) . Except for Haruhi , the other members of the SOS-brigade is Kyon . He is the real protagonist of the show . It's trough his point of view that we follow the story . He just happen to sit in front in class when Haruhi came up with the idea to form the SOS-Brigade . He is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that Haruhi don't go to much to the extremes , and he is the only one in the class that Haruhi likes to talk with . Another member is Yuki Nagato , which is the " indispensable silent member " and is also the only remaining member of the Literature club , which room the SOS-Brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room . She doesn't mind that the SOS-Brigade uses her clubroom , as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books . She also participate in the brigades activities . Mikuru Asahina was " voluntarily arrested " by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious to happen . She often act as the clubs maid . The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi , who happens to be the " mysterious transfer student " ( meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which Haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious ) . < br / > < br / > Haruhi thinks that all members but Kyon are some random picked people in school , but the do indeed have their own interest in her .
This film is really quite odd . Clearly certain * events * portrayed identify the main protagonist as the Dublin criminal known as " The General " but almost everything else is just wrong . We are not talking of a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of irrefutable , documented facts . The question indeed is why ? The garda are shown as latter day Keystone Cops , his gang as non-menacing , and the man himself as .. well Kevin Spacey . Almost pure fiction anyway , why bother to try to give a semblance of realism ? Having said all that , it is a poor exercise * any * way you want to look at it . Not worth a second of anyone's time .
I had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie " These Girls " at the Philadelphia Film Festival . Going into the movie , I knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting . So as I entered the theater just hours ago I wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down . < br / > < br / > " These Girls " is the story about three best friends from a small town . Keira ( Caroline Dhavernas ) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do . Lisa ( Holly Lewis ) will be going away to a Christian school after the summer . And finally , Glory ( Amanda Walsh ) who plans on spending her summer babysitting . But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail Keith Clark ( David Boreanaz ) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for . Fun times and a lot of laughs ensue < br / > < br / > I normally don't like movies like " These Girls " but there is something about this movie that I really liked . I think the quality I liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic . Three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later . It's a pretty funny tale about growing up , friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy I can see majority of this film happening in real life . < br / > < br / > The subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the United States . All the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if I remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16 . Now in the USA even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content . This information was actually confirmed by the director himself John Hazlett at the Q & A after the film . The thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor . Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life . Go figure . < br / > < br / > What the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters . I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a " Now & Then " characteristic to them . The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top . Everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama . The script was very strong . < br / > < br / > The acting was very good for the most part . I thought all the three girls were great . Caroline Dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time " Wonderfalls " was just terrific ; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh who both did a fine job as well . David Boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes . The guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role . < br / > < br / > I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film . I am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere . I think with a little marketing behind it , it could have taken off . Sadly it's going to be one of these direct to DVD films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see . I think with what little budget Mr . Hazlett had to work with , the film turned out well and I think he did a fine job directing this little gem . < br / > < br / > For someone who typically hates teen sex comedies I can honestly say I really enjoyed this film . The character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused . This is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it . I know I will be sure to buy this film when it comes on DVD on May 16 , 2006 . If you're a fan of coming of age stories , teen sex comedies , or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years . < br / > < br / > MovieManMenzel's final rating for " These Girls " is an 8/ 10 .
Okay , granted , I am a fan of low-budget horror , which along with it , does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to ... TRANCERS 6 , directed by DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel . < br / > < br / > First of all , the TRANCERS series , started back in the mid - 80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures , is basically the franchise that it is because of Tim Thomerson and his excellent portrayal of Trancer hunter Jack Deth . Well , low and behold , due to the sinking budgets of Full Moon features ( which , despite what people have said , have actually brought along very high quality features , such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING ) , Thomerson did not return for the sixth installment . < br / > < br / > Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns once again and delivers another below-average screenplay , which features Jack Deth ( played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks , which are extremely poorly inserted ... he has a different hair style like every time he is shown , and some ` shemp ' laying on a table ) going down the line into his daughter's body . Well , from here on out , you have " Jo Deth " acting like Jack ... but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as Jack Deth did . < br / > < br / > The film , shot on 16mm , is , simply put , an embarrassment to the TRANCERS name ... no offense to anyone at Young Wolf Productions . I mean , I respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a TRANCERS film without Tim , but with a little more time ( despite it being filmed since December of 2001 ) , it could have been better . < br / > < br / > However , check out Full Moon's DVD of it , which is a double feature with the original TRANCERS , and features trailers for the last 10 plus Full Moon features . < br / > < br / > Overall , I would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the TRANCERS name , but like anything , you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself !
I saw ' Begotten ' last night , and I'm of two minds on the film . < br / > < br / > On one hand , I appreciate it for being the total invert of a Michael Bay film . No dialogue , extremely stylized grainy B & W photography , some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film , and a very compelling use of sound ( which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet ) . It's a reflection on a theme , and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images , but of production and concept . It's a movie that most people don't understand , and if you read through these comments you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about ' pretentiousness ' with the fervor of a gibbon rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time . It genuinely shocked and disturbed me , and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago . < br / > < br / > On the other , this is a thirty-minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half . I understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon , but in this case it just doesn't help everything hang together . Imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who grabys you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being ... but then , instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake , he just keeps talking and talking and talking . By the end of the movie , I found myself glancing at my watch now and again . < br / > < br / > This is not entertainment , people . This is disentertainment . This is how you deprogram people who just watched " Glitter . " If you watch movies to be entertained , this will frustrate , confound , and possibly anger you . You don't approach ' Begotten ' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good . You approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before , something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door , something that's dark and glistens and twitches on its platter ; something you order not because it will taste good , but because you just have to know what it's like .
After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers we flashback to 1989 where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes . Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby . In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut . The Score is much better , more in line with parts 4 and 5 , none of the electric guitar BS . And the ending makes a tad more sense . For these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense , and cuts back on the gore factor ( Halloween , unlike say the " Friday the 13th " Franschise , was never about blatant gore ) is why I prefer this bootleg Producer's cut . Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold , it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible . The whole cult plot is still very stupid , as is Micheal fathering a kid < br / > < br / > My Producer's Cut Grade : C - < br / > < br / > My Theatrical Cut Grade : D -
I adore Hedy Lamarr . I think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s . She was the Nastassja Kinski of that era , and critics didn't take her seriously . Having said all that ... this film is a BORE . When I watched it for the first time , I was shocked at the lack of continuity , not only in story , but in makeup and costumes . Hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot . So does hair length and style . Reason : This thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all . Her " Lady of the Tropics " began filming AFTER this one began , yet it was released before " I Take This Woman . " In fact , at the time , it was known in Hollywood as " I Re-Take This Woman . " That should tell you something . I'm a Spencer Tracy fan as well , but he is AWFUL here . I've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr , and that looks perfectly obvious on film . NO chemisty whatsoever . The story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely . I can't recommend this one at all .
After 66 years " Flash Gordon " still has an appealing scifi / adventure / epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures strive for and fail to deliver . The only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit back and not pick at anything ( hokey effects , dialogue , why Flash doesn't go for Princess Aura etc . ) . And as for you older people who saw " Flash Gordon " back on the serial screen or on T . V . " back in the day " , if you want this fine serial to remain appealing to future generations , get your kids / grandkids to watch this when they're young . It worked for me ( Male aged 18 or under ) . 9 out of 10
This movie has become an iconic stand-in for what is great about America . < br / > < br / > Fame is famous for its music and performances . There are several standout actors , singers , and dancers , including Irene Cara , Paul McCrae , Anne Meara * , and the superb Gene Anthony Ray . < br / > < br / > The plot is not the movie . It follows an interesting format ... but , it all really ends in a kind of mush . < br / > < br / > Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant , sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances . < br / > < br / > The film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians , dancers , & score by Christopher Gore . A wonderment to behold . < br / > < br / > * An interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented Anne Meara ... sometimes talent must reside in the genes ... Ms . Meara is married to one Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller ...
The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared . When the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left , shocking images of blood , dismemberment , and various abominations are released . Religion won't save you , nor will mother nature or your own family . Hussain's dark poetry , because that's what this film really is , destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary . < br / > < br / > ` Subconcious Cruelty ' is a current crowd pleaser on the horror \ fantasy festival circuit . The film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound . The protagonist's desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic . From here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature . Hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness . Nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in Hussain's frightening enlightenment . < br / > < br / > ` Subconcious Cruelty ' is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life , lust and madness this very worthy film explores . CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up , as do David Kristian for unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for score .
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish . I knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies . It was all downhill after this . Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah . This was the music hall version of this character , previously and admirably played by Roland Young . And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David . Dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer . < br / > < br / > This was one time when Hollywood knew more than jolly old England .
Ignore the comment before mine . The show is comic genius , most underrated show ever . 3 reasons why . Reason 1 , the flashbacks are hilarious , who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story , they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't that the idea of a good comedy programme ? People who think this isn't funny just have no sense of humour . Who cares if they are random , its a t . v . show , you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic , neither is a cartoon , its animated . Reason 2 , The jokes are just generally hilarious , Seth McFarlane and the other writers are sooo funny , everything from the Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities , i love them all . And Reason 3 , the story lines are just brilliant and funny , they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness , just all the more funnier . < br / > < br / > I caught this one late night on BBC 2 and have never gone back , i have all 7 seasons , plus the kind of movie thing ( Stewie Griffin : The Untold Story ) , i have several t-shirts , posters and my collection is still growing . I've never got a collection of any TV show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything . < br / > < br / > Just watch season 3 and trust me you will be hooked for life , the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends !
Martin Lawrence is not a funny man i Runteldat . He just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game . He tries to make fun of critics , which boils down to " f * * * them " . Then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there . 3/10
And she really was beautiful ( Laraine Day , that is ) - herself , her part , and her performance . An engaging story of selfish vs . selfless love , for the same man , wealthy heartthrob and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings . One of his bouts of inebriation leads to an incident that enrages the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters ( Jean Muir and Laraine Day ) that are close to him ( and to each other ) . Their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu is up-ended as the two girls confront the ensuing crisis and respond to its conflicting demands of prudence , integrity , loyalty , and love , with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them . With the old vanities and niceties abandoned , their real characters are revealed in enthralling contrast . < br / > < br / > A wonderful find on TCM !
I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well . Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role . We saw Ms . Carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her naked , smoked a cigarette , drank beer and oh she cursed . Whenever this movie was shown on TV and finally cable I would call my friends to watch it . Just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips . We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children , dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself . Finally this movie made it to DVD and well deserving .
In relative terms having watched a lot of disgustingly bad tele Tom Fontana & Levinson are geniuses for creating & delivering In this writer's book the greatest ever TV show . Oz was treated horribly In this country , the finale went out well gone 3 In the morning , before that It was strictly considered alternative viewing for those oblivious to prime time garbage . < br / > < br / > I first caught Oz towards the end of the first series and from then on It was an unmissable watch . My man Adebisi possibly the most Intimidating villain ever , Beacher the perfect anti-hero , Eammon Walker's Saeed an acting class In evocation . There was the hardcore stuff of course - some plain evil but essentially Oz had soul . Augustus narrates the unfolding plot with pearls of Insight while the struggles of Beacher , Mcmanus , Saeed , Rebedahl etc are better than any soap opera before or since . Compassion violence wisdom tragedy Intelligence pain joy brutality love & heroism Oz went through the spectrum of human emotion - all Inside a max security prison ! < br / > < br / > I can honestly say those Thursday nights with the great Vids to follow Oz series 2/3 way back In 99 were the best TV I'll ever see . Beacher assaulting Vern In the gym Is a moment I don't need a video for - a small screen classic I'll never forget . < br / > < br / > Imagine what Oz would have done with the same push as the Sopranos given a 10 pm timeslot and all the promos ? ? ? Fine I'm over that now , for those that caught It consider yourself privileged for those who didn't TV is shite ... and you deserve It .
This was a very disappointing movie . I would definitely call this the worst movie of all time . < br / > < br / > The acting and writing were poor . And the jokes were not funny . < br / > < br / > I don't see why on earth this piece of crap was even made . I'm not a picky person and I can enjoy stupid things but this is just way too stupid and just plain awful . < br / > < br / > Avoid this wretched piece of garbage at all costs !
While the songs and dance numbers , in general , aren't as strong as many would have them be , the film's storyline and message are still there and ring out loudly above the simple 70s - style musical numbers . < br / > < br / > Keeping in mind that this film was made after the Hollywood Musical had nearly died out ( with few exceptions being rock musicals ) , the audiences that went to see it new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadn't been done to date . Audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and , perhaps , the huge all-star casts of musicals gone past . But to do that to this film , or any for that matter , is an injustice to the film itself . < br / > < br / > There are some good musical moments in the film . The first is that of Bobby Van . Mr . Van took his role of Harry Lovett just after closing a 2 year Tony nominated ( for best actor ) run of the Broadway revival , " No , No , Nanette . " He is a song-and-dance-man from way back and , honestly , the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals . He never misses a step in his " Question Me An Answer " and rightly so ... he was totally at home as Harry . Other pleasant numbers are done by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak , James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the " Family " song , as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece . < br / > < br / > View the film for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never grow old , hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of Tibet , found by a group of unsuspecting modern-day people wrapped up in the strife of any modern culture . Take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal . But ... take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that . < br / > < br / > To some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the hectic pace of reality . To the first , try to not judge and just enjoy the message . To the second , you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La !
No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert " Famishius Famishius " Coyote tries to get Road " Burnius Roadibus " Runner , we always know what's going to happen , though our sympathy always remains with WEC . The highlight in " Hook , Line and Stinker " is a Rube Goldberg-style scheme that WEC hopes will finally finish off RR ; but of course you know what happens . < br / > < br / > So , Wile E . continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism ( defined by George Santayana as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim ) while Road Runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself . A real classic . < br / > < br / > And yes , the coyote's middle name is Ethelbert . I learned that from " Jeopardy ! " .
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out . They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited . It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . Then it did a nosedive . Critics HATED this film . I don't remember seeing one good review . Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque . I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars , women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol . When I was younger , I didnt care for that . It was Hulkamania , brother ! ! ! < br / > < br / > Now I find this pretty bad , but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with Bodyslam ( which has a better storyline ) . First off , Hulk Hogan's acting skills just aren't great . he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring . And actually , Rip and Hulk are not to far off from each other . Kurt Fuller is a good actor , but he is not good at playing the bad guy . He is better at comedy and nervous drama characters . He is just not believable as Brell . There isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of Randy , Rip's brother and Charlie the trainer ( In wrestling its unheard of a trainer escourting a wrestler to the ring lol ) . Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way its supposed to be played , so there isnt any problem there . Joan Severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds , she does have a lingerie scene lol . By the end , you figure , what's the point ? < br / > < br / > For this one ( as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star ) , turn your brain off . You'll enjoy it more if you do .
This was a pretty dull movie , actually . I think the problem with a French horror film , is that the French must be easy to scare or something , because this movie wasn't just that frightening . The special effects with the mummy's ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film , as though someone put them in during post-production to spice them up , because the actors barely react to them . < br / > < br / > The plot just kind of meanders , which is the opposite of real storytelling . I guess this was based on a French TV series , where they had to distill it down to a two-hour movie . < br / > < br / > The plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the Louvre , which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times . ( So THAT'S how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa ! ) The boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960 ' s version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon . < br / > < br / > So I'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not . He kills two guards during the course of the movie , but he just wants to get to the afterlife .
Duck_of_Death needs to watch this film again , as his major criticism is completely baseless . The film never once forgot about the time delay , and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places . The crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn't obey the time delay rules . < br / > < br / > One thing I did think was a bit far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours ? I doubt it . Would a manned space ship go into a star's corona ? I doubt it . Would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation ? I doubt it . Also , the ship seemed overly sturdy . Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down ? I doubt it . Would it survive being hit by comet debris ? I doubt it . I think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much . But all-in-all , the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects , good editing and production , and some good acting , especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut .
The director has no clue . I know ... That is the obvious comment . Maybe , we should delve into the story ... the relationships ... how about the quality of the actors ? < br / > < br / > The story is ... well , idiotic would be a simple yet honest answer . < br / > < br / > The actors are ... they tried very hard . Can they be faulted for the director's choices ? < br / > < br / > All I can say is ... < br / > < br / > Why was this made ? < br / > < br / > Well , isn't this an embarrassment to the Korean-American film industry ? < br / > < br / > Should we be selective about who we support ? < br / > < br / > Am I being too harsh ? Check it out for yourself .
This was the most god awful movie I have had to sit through . 30 minutes into the film and I couldn't take any more . Seriously , do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured . Boring , although the acting is fine ; the kid is just plain irritating . Some scenes are a little strange with very weird close-ups . I don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white , but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably . There was just nothing to watch , and although its a sad tale , supposedly , its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters .
I recently rented this film on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as I am both from the north of England ( Bradford ) , and also interested in film-making . However , it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script-wise . The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance . The subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film . However , the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused . < br / > < br / > The ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters - punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary . This felt a little awkward and silly , and seemed at odds with the ' realism ' used in the style of shooting . For me , the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner . It felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow-barring everything else in to fit it . < br / > < br / > Another point that I feel strongly about is the watered-down Ken Loach feel the film had . I get quite upset that UK film financiers can't see that there is more to British films than ' gritty realism ' . It has become almost a safe option . Film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by UK feature film producers . There is a lot of talent here in the UK . It's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100 % of the time or they go to America . < br / > < br / > Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-off TV drama .
Being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama , this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced , and utterly unbelievable in every way . The pace is constantly fever-pitched , and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria . It is nigh unwatchable , and a stain - nay , a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved . < br / > < br / > The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself , resulting in a movie where you just go " Come on ! " all the time . The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously . I can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10 . < br / > < br / > If you want to see a good asteroid movie , see Deep Impact , which is intense , sensitive and thoroughly engrossing . Everything Armageddon is not .
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image . Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes , this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day . Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs . Its an naughty little tale for adults . If you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex , which is how I first saw the film years ago on cable TV . The relatively recent home video release on DVD put back the sex ( in horribly grainy inserted clips ) which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around . If you're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy I can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion .
A lovely librarian , played by Playboy model Kristine DeBell , falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely uninhibited people These people love to sing and dance and fool around Alice has a series of sensual adventures among these characters < br / > < br / > The film was originally shot as a poem to eroticism with few explicit sex scenes , which were eventually cut from its theatrical release Videocassette versions , however , have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with them < br / > < br / > For an extremely low-budget picture , the producers of this film did an extremely good job The cinematography is full of life and energy , the dances and numbers quite professional , and the acting lovable Without a doubt , it is one of the best adult fairy tales around
John has made two One man shows . Spic O Rama and Freaks , and neither one has shown up on DVD ... John ! ! ! Why do you this to me john ? ? Put it on DvD John , so the people can see , they need to see John ! ! :D ... Just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye ! !
A very bizarre bringing to the screen of William Shakespeare's tragic love story . < br / > < br / > The Que family and the Capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence . The hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy . In the middle of all of this insanity are Tromeo and Juliet , literature's most famous " star crossed " lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to . < br / > < br / > The film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original , or close to original , lines . But the infamous Troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end . That makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes , but it is nonetheless pretty inventive . Tyrone ( Tybalt in Shakespeare ) has a particularly funny death scene . 7/10 < br / > < br / > Many differently edited and rated versions exist . Each contains violence , profanity , drug use , and sex , all with a big dose of bizarreness .
As it turns out , Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together ( " Coneheads " , " Tommy Boy " and " Black Sheep " ) , but this was truly the " Citizen Kane " of their pairings . Farley plays Thomas Callahan III , the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company . His father Big Tom ( Brian Dennehy ) hires mild-mannered Richard Hayden ( David Spade ) to look after him . Big Tom is getting married to a " ten " ( Bo Derek ) , so everything has to be in order . After Big Tom suddenly dies , Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy . From then on , the movie is pretty much an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best : make a mess of everything . < br / > < br / > When this movie first came out in the theaters , I saw it with my grandfather . He figured out early on that the Bo Derek and Rob Lowe characters were hiding something . But you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in Chris Farley's antics . Nothing is safe around his stomach , and hell hath no fury like his happy-go-lucky attitude . The scene where he sets the cars on fire , and later the deer scene , make for a pure laugh riot . Chris Farley and David Spade were truly the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era . It's a pleasure to always be able to think about " Fat guy in a little coat " time and again .
Wow ... just ... wow . There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own . I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting , writing , and directing - whoo boy does it ever . However , I think there is some other problems here . < br / > < br / > 1 . Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive ? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility ? Why ? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film ( i . e . " The Bible doesn't say there is aliens . " " Well , the Bible doesn't say there isn't . ) , but the actual rebuttal is never answered . The Bible really doesn't say there isn't . So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand ? Or better yet , acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them . < br / > < br / > 2 . How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax ? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences ? What if it's something else entirely ? Too bad the film makers already have their minds made up . < br / > < br / > 3 . The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult . That's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present . I'm not necessarily arguing that they don't , but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up . < br / > < br / > 4 . Why does the other reporter ( not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy , the other one ) always have his hands in his pockets ? It's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool . < br / > < br / > I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena , but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their " Faith Message " to care much about make a thought provoking movie . As a Christian myself , this saddens me .
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film . < br / > < br / > He took five years to make it , a labour of love and longing . I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process , what to leave in , what to take out . < br / > < br / > His father , the renowned architect Louis Kahn , comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three . But like many men of his character , he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity . < br / > < br / > One of his mistresses said he was " accessible " but that is never explored . Other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate . A pity . < br / > < br / > The tension between the three half-siblings in the room of a home Louis designed is also palpable . The unsaid hovers over the conversation . The only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind , some great , some not so great . < br / > < br / > I was captivated by the music ship and the Salk Institute . Saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous impregnations never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy - " not again ! " < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 , beautifully filmed , genuine . < br / > < br / > It appears , in this case at least , the son is not the father of the man .
If pulp fiction and Get shorty didn't exist this might be an OK film.When i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it's own unless it's another bit of terrible dialogue or a cliché full scene.All the lines like ' i won't say more than i have to if that ' from Get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel , all the cameos like Steven Tyler's are acted terribly and are not needed and as for Christina Milian , man , don't get me started.Sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from The rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors , Vince Vaughn.The man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk.Cedric the entertainer and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act { i personally think the background actors were better than Cedric and Andre } and the only funny part of the acting of Cedric , Andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that.So in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably , it doesn't have any new material , comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it's brilliant predecessor Get shorty.Oh yes i forgot to mention there is a BIG cliché at the end .
Occasionally I accidentally leave the television on after " South Park " and I end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is " Mind of Mencia " . It's the only time I wish my room was cleaner because I'd be able to find the remote that much faster . The truth is Comedy Central was in need of a replacement " Chappelle's Show " , and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss Dave so much they'll cling to any minority variety show , or are satisfied with the plain " Mexicans love tacos " jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels in every week . I am to understand , though , that there are some people out there that actually find Mencia * shudder * funny . I firmly stand by my words when I say I believe these people to exist only in myth . However , if you are indeed out there , I ask only that you never enter into my housing district , and read these major differences between Carlos and " Chappelle's Show " : < br / > < br / > 1 ) Dave was funny . You may want to highlight this one . < br / > < br / > 2 ) " Chappelle's Show " was FIVE TIMES as edgy as Mencia could ever hope to be . Yet every time a promo for his little show airs , it's all about him , tooting his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before . You've got that right , Carlos . And not in a good way . Chappelle didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny . We all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves . < br / > < br / > 3 ) Chappelle actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures - things that some people didn't know about . Like his " I know black people " game segment . The grand prize was some hair cream that black people use . That's deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive . So how dare he call himself edgy ? If Mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid . And my accusations have some merit . I saw a promo for his show ( which I have affectionately come to call ' My T . V . Monitor Taking A S--t For Thirty Minutes ' ) a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch , which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept . Then I saw that the Mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize . That's it ? ! That's as close to the fire as you wanna get ? Who COULDN'T think of that - back in 7th grade ? For you fans of the show , if you're ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines - perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how " Duh-De-Durr " never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say - just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway : green card , tacos , border jumpers , lawn mowers , and of course , duh-de-dur . Just remember-whichever it was , it was screamed . Enjoy ! < br / > < br / > 4 ) Kind of relating to number two . Every time he says something that gets a laugh , he'll pause to tell people ( while laughing at his own joke ) that he thinks he " went too far with that last one " . Then don't say it for God's sake . Or let the people decide by themselves . He and Comedy Central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that he's this tell-it-like-it-is show that is more controversial than " The Da Vinci Code " . You're not . You never will be . < br / > < br / > I've never been offended by the show's content . I would never give it that much credit . I'm offended that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily . Yeah ... I'm literally offended by that fact .
A study of one of those universally familiar , physical and / or emotional states : isolation . I think the film also comments on cultural displacement too . < br / > < br / > The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men ( cousins ) . One has money ( and the comforts that come of having ' made-it ' with a steady income ); the other has none and goes in search of work . Neither are happy . Expect no celebration of life here - this is loneliness , warts and all . < br / > < br / > The film succeeds in offering a powerfully bleak traverse across the ' low lands ' of the human condition . Brave film-making . Well-acted and well-shot in my view ( outdoor shots by the harbour being my own favourites ) . A film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfilment in life ( not to mention employment ); everyone else will find a companion in this film . A film with all the warmth and pace of an ice-floe . Expect a bitter pill , not a ' happy pill . '
Peter Segal's 1995 commercial hit & now cult-classic ' Tommy Boy ' is a hilarious film , an evergreen entertainer . Chris Farley is a talent which we'll never ever forget ! ! ! < br / > < br / > ' Tommy Boy ' is a simple story , told in the funniest & zany way possible . Farley & Spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter , even the Rob Lowe portion is damn funny . As a kid , I remember watching ' Tommy Boy ' again and again and again . It's been of my childhood favorites , and it will always remain to be . Even today when it comes on T . V . I stick to it as a die-hard fan . I am quite possessive about this film . < br / > < br / > Segal's direction is super . Chris Farley might have died in 1997 , but remains alive for me , at least . What an actor ! Watch his work in ' Tommy Boy ' , he's so much at ease . He delivered fantastic performances later on in films like ' Berverly Hills Ninja ' & ' Almost Heroes ' , but his work in here remains as his best to date ! Love you , Farley ! Spade , on the other hand , is as good as ever . He's an excellent actor in all respects ! < br / > < br / > ' Tommy Boy ' rules ... 100 thumbs up from this writer !
I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is , but I couldn't find it . It's a really long , barely credible , hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set . < br / > < br / > It doesn't move anywhere , the characters are just totally bizarre , the underlying plot equally so . It's lost on me , definitely a walk out movie . < br / > < br / > The one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax , and the fact that , all irritation aside at the banal personalities , they're acted quite reasonably . But you have to brace yourself for endless dialog , wishing on many an occasion that Teach would just shut the % * & * up for a moment .
Some weeks ago , at a movie theater , I saw a movie poster of El Padrino ( 2004 ) with the tag " The Latin Godfather " . How lame have we become , I thought , Latin just because he is a Mexican ? Let me remind you that ANYTHING Latin comes from or is related to Latium , Italy , So the original guy in the Godfather movie is more Latin than the Mexican Godfather and this is why : We are called Latin-American people because we speak Spanish , a language based in the Latin language that originated in Rome now Italy . So to place a tag in a movie poster like " The Latin Godfather " , is not just ignorant , of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original Godfather , but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic . Now about the movie , I just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 I guess is 3 the most .
One of Warner Brothers best and highest grossing films during the Thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his maiden sister raising Four Daughters . But not four every day type daughters . All of them have been trained by their musician father on instruments and one as a singer . They do make some beautiful music together even if it is for the long haired set . < br / > < br / > You can watch the infinite variety of roles that Claude Rains played over the years and still marvel as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality . The opportunistic Vichy Captain in Casablanca is as different as the scientist gone mad in the Invisible Man , as the patient and wise Job in Mr . Skeffington . All the same man and all so incredibly different . < br / > < br / > Here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a little grouchiness at their willingness to accept modern music . The Lane Sisters and Gale Page may know Beethoven , but they're hep cats as well and can beat daddy eight to the bar every time . And if Rains gets a bit too testy than Aunt May Robson can put him in his place . < br / > < br / > With Four Daughters unmarried at the time you know that's going to change . All the sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran , Frank McHugh , Jeffrey Lynn , and John Garfield . Of course the mating process does get a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy , but it does promise to work out as the film ends . < br / > < br / > Four Daughters is also known as the debut film of John Garfield . Other than a tiny bit part in Footlight Parade years earlier , Garfield had no other film roles . But he'd been acclaimed on the New York stage for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed him and found the perfect film debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life . It earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1938 , but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky . < br / > < br / > This film was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for Jack Warner . Sequels with cast members like Daughters Courageous , Four Mothers , Four Wives all cleaned up at the box office before World War II . And Warner Brothers remade it with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane originated . Now those two made some beautiful music . < br / > < br / > Still a timeless mold was created in Four Daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen .
If you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of Mount Everest , then you may enjoy this movie . Just skip ahead to the views of the mountain . < br / > < br / > ( Spoiler Alert ) However , if you , like me , believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth . 6 people died , 5 Sherpas and a member of the Japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down Mount Everest . < br / > < br / > The question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives , and he answers an emphatic " Yes " . < br / > < br / > The part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes . He skis for a short time , then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow .
ABC's version of the life of the late Pope : They put it just slightly ahead of CBS's version and it may have suffered from that but the program itself was excellent . It moved fast since it only had two hours ( with commercials also taking up time ) to cover this great man's long life , but Thomas Kretschmann admirably was up to the challenge.He did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and strife that John-Paul endured.He - unlike the CBS biopic - played the role from youth to old age and managed to seem " realistic " at both ends of the scale.His credibility never wavered.He has an amazing range and depth . It is a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the time frame they did have , I think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen .
Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy , and Tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous . The story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving . < br / > < br / > Set in ( let's say ) a suburb of Newark , the plot would be deemed ridiculous . All that saves the movie are the Tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in Florence and Positano , and a film of the while-the-sun-sinks-slowly-in-the-west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world .
I myself am a physics student , and I have to say I think this is one of the best ' popular ' introductions to string theory that's out there . The Elegant Universe manages to make the entire topic of string ( although it's actually M ) theory accessible to a wider audience . < br / > < br / > Some ' popular science ' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end , throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation , and presenting the theory in a boring , stale style . This programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics , and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale . < br / > < br / > I suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes , but the thing is : that's against the point . Explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base , and the way it's explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining . < br / > < br / > Whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that Greene presents : extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life , are they ? But , if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme , you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today . And if you're studying physics , well , it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more !
* * * SPOILERS * * * For some strange reason Oliver Stone's " Talk Radio " based on the Stephen Singular book " Talked to Death " and the films star Eric Bogosian's play , about the 1984 murder of Denver talk show host Alan Berg , has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved . The 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of America . A movement that spawned , some seven years later , the likes of an angry and disgruntled Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh who's hatred for the US governments actions in Wacco Texas lead to his and friend , Terry Nichols , detonation of the US Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 that took the lives of 168 people , the worst act of terrorism on US soil up to that time . < br / > < br / > The movie is , as far as I know , the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel " The Turner Diaries " by the late William L . Pierce , that has since become a chilling underground classic . " The Turner Diaries " forecast a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack , like the Oklahoma City bombing , on a US Government Federal facility which was the FBI Building in Washington D . C . < br / > < br / > Dallas radio station KGAB talk show host Barry Champlain , Eric Bogosian , is the top rated show in the Dallas listening area and is now about to go national . Barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air . Taking on all comers and ducking no issues , no matter how unpopular or taboo they are , has gotten Barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio . Barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his abrasiveness to his call-in listeners as his rating go up to the celling . But there are those in the listening audience , mostly ultra right wing types , that don't take too kindly to his in your face attitude . One of them decides to take matters into his on hand at Barry's expense . < br / > < br / > Powerhouse performance by Eric Bogosian as the tragic Barry Champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio . Thinking that he's not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside . Also in the movie " Talk Radio " is a very young Alic Baldwin as Barry's boss Dan who tries to have him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he's killing the competition not realizing that in the end it's him that he'll end up getting killed . < br / > < br / > Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life his ex-wife Ellen and now lover and talk show producer Laura whom Barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time . The 1988 film " Talk Radio " is so far ahead of it's time that even if you watch it now in 2005 you still think that it's too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate American public .
A sadly predictable , clichéd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been . Sadly , too , the screenplay is by the once-great experimental novelist John Dos Passos , from an original by French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys . This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha , a manipulative , cold-hearted Spanish beauty . Don Pasqual ( Lionel Atwill ) raises her from the cigarette factory , but she ditches him . He warns his tall young friend Antonio ( Cesar Romero ) against her , but to no avail . A duel ensues , Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for , so he doesn't : he points his pistol at the sky , but Antonio shoots him . But instead of going off to Paris with the young victor , she goes back to the man who would have died for her . With an unexpected bit by Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish Governor . Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman by moving constantly , twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back , flouncing , tossing her head , and so forth . And she makes faces , and has a curl in the middle of her forehead . The photography is strangely crowded : no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees , no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room , no consecutive scene of Dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change . The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea .
I saw Forgiving the Franklins at a Paramount screening and loved it I have to be honest I really didn't want to go and I had become quite jaded about the movies being made today I have to tell you Forgiving The Franklins was fresh and wonderfully put together I laughed my ass off it was great story telling I could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together . I thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them . And then I thought be the jaded guy Iam the studios would probably f ... it up anyway . That being said thanks guys I got lost and in your film and that's why I go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours .
the first toxie film was dark , gory , and hillarious . This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music , no real gore at all , and the worst toxie mask I have ever seen ! His deep voice is now a light , happy voice , characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look NOTHING like them ( Claire , Mom Junko ) , characters names change ( Claire or Sara ? ) . It is lacking all the brutal violence , dark humor , and political incorrectness of the first film . If it weren't for nudity , this movie could have been rated PG . Really lame . I am a HUGE fan of part 1 though , just cant stand this one .
I completely disagree with the other comments ! I too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable . Robin Williams is in top form . True , the tone is familiar , but it is Williams of Good Morning Vietnam : smart , funny , on point . After too many dark turns , Williams is finally back to what he does best . The supporting actors give great performances , especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken . Chris plays himself , as usual , but as the " agent " to the next president he was a delight each time on screen . Lewis Black plays only himself basically , but he is wonderfully well used here . There is also a fun turn by Jeff Goldblum . The movie is more than what the trailer suggests , as well . The movie is funny , but it is not a pure comedy as suggested . It has a bit of a thriller line , which everyone should seriously consider , especially if you pay attention to the newspaper .
Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon ( associate producer Joe Morton ) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education , fail & they will never become qualified Doctors . A bright , young , attractive & intelligent student named Eve ( Kelly Overton ) is given a particularly difficult patient to study . His name is Don Wake ( James Haven ) & is a convicted killer , he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman ( Diane Verona ) & her young daughter ( Jenette McCurdy ) . At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her , but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out . Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve , he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay . Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn , as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred . Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient ... ? < br / > < br / > Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn . Now , we all like a good twist ending , the sort of ending which catches us unawares , surprises us , works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) & Fight Club ( 1999 ) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream ( 1996 ) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious . Then , of course , there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take , oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film , never . Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve , it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest , it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that bad a film until the twist ending , I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point ( which was OK to be fair to it ) suddenly becomes irrelevant . I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail , all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will . Breaking Dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history , it's as simple & straight forward as that . < br / > < br / > Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller , maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot . He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day . < br / > < br / > Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout . The acting is pretty good , Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance . Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse ( 1980 ) , City of the Living Dead ( 1980 ) , The House on the Edge of the Park ( 1980 ) , Cannibal Ferox ( 1981 ) , Stagefright ( 1987 ) & The Church ( 1989 ) ? OK , maybe it was just me ... < br / > < br / > Breaking Dawn is rubbish , I hated it all because of the final few minutes . Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK . Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb ...
WHENEVER an idea was successful during those " Golden Days " of the Silent Movies , you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated ; although " Reworking " is the term that is used . Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us , for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend ; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program . < br / > < br / > TO this last premise we strongly disagree ; for this is copycatting or plagiarism , plain and simple . < br / > < br / > THIS , the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short , surely must have been quite well received ; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach / MGM , 1929 ) was reworked on the Roach Lot , not once , but twice over the next three years . We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach / MGM , 1931 ) , in which the Goat was replaced with a cute , little puppy-dog . Also , the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter , in the middle of a blizzard . They also made other line-up changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall . < br / > < br / > THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler , THE CHIMP ( Roach / MGM , 1932 ) , which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus , to which Stan and Babe were former employees . The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday . < br / > < br / > BACK to our original ' victim ' , today's subject , ANGORA LOVE . Recomember ? THE short starts off simply enough . The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house ; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her . The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slow-burn exponent , Edgar Kennedy , their Landlord . The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night . And as luck would have it ; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters . < br / > < br / > IN addition to the noise , the bathing of the goat , its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room ; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag , which may well have been missed by the Censors . While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight , regardless of their sex . < br / > < br / > ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room , over their shoulder . With Edgar in the hall and facing them , he warns ; " Remember , this is a respectable establishment ! " Just as he says this , a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord ; followed by a uniformed Sailor , who cocks his hat forward as they pass ! POODLE SCHNITZ ! !
Jack Brooks ( Trevor Matthews ) is a college student with some severe anger issues . His family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster , and now he takes out his anger on everything and everyone . < br / > < br / > So when his professor ( Robert Englund ) begins to show signs of monsterism , he learns he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil , and fight the creatures that have been haunting his nightmares ever since that fateful night . < br / > < br / > Truly earns its B-rated rating , but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy B-rated CGI graphics . In fact , 0 % of the film was CGI . The monsters were actually decently put together , and although the storyline was lacking , it was somewhat watchable ... if for only one time .
There seems to have been some money behind this film , but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn't actually started watching it . < br / > < br / > To begin with , once we are in the cavern with the characters ( the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early ' 80s ) , the film is shot almost entirely in close-up . Since the actors are wearing helmet lights , this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see ; so when they shout out " Look there ! " we are left to beg " What ? ! Where ? ! " . Ultimately the film has a nauseating , confusing strobe-light effect , with no sense to it until we get to the end . < br / > < br / > And I won't tell you what ' the end ' means - but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early ' 60s Arch Hall laugh fest " Eegah ! " with Richard Kiel . < br / > < br / > But what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like " Eegah ! " ' s , long remembered as one of the worst films ever made ? ! But that's what we have here , folks . Except that , unlike " Eegah ! " , " The Cavern " is not anyone's idea of goofy fun . It is unwatchable . ( I ran it at x2 the normal speed , just to get it over with , hoping I would actually be able to see something by the end of the film ; but when I did , it was just stupid . ) This film did provide me with one satisfying moment , though ; since it only cost a couple bucks , after I got it out of the DVD player , I was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief !
Well in to 2002 I've got some catching up to do . And looking back on a lacklustre year , Best In Show shone . No great storyline . Little action . Just a cavalcade of magnificent characters . Particular reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a rattling pair of TV commentators . Well done . Well worth the effort . < br / > < br / > Ron ( Viewed 24Mar2001 )
The perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie : < br / > < br / > 1 . Take one burnt-out , rogue ex-cop with a bad attitude , yet a sensitive touch as well ( closet concert pianist with a pet cat );< br / > < br / > 2 . Add some " cool " retro gadgets like a beat-up Porsche 356 , a roaring bike , a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles ; < br / > < br / > 3 . Mix in a couple of " free-spirit " locations e . g . a trendy sea-side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office ; < br / > < br / > 4 . Spice it up with " deep " socio-romantic themes such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-remarrying-ex-wife , a secretly-admiring-and-therefore-forgiving-waitress , a pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-whom-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-buddy-getting-iced-over-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal - $ $ $ ; < br / > < br / > 5 . Let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a " fast-paced " though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes , cheap tender moments and sluggish wise-cracks ; < br / > < br / > 6 . Serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting ( don't worry : even the yellow pages will do ! ) .
I just watched Lonesome Dove , Return To Lonesome Dove , Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk . All excellent . This sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted . < br / > < br / > In the previous series , Captain Call and Gus McCrae come off as tough respectable cowboys . Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over . In Dead Man's Walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced Texas rangers . In Comanche Moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks . I had to stop watching . < br / > < br / > I suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile . It's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise .
I always loved this film . The music , story and the action . I especially love the opening and closing of the film . The music stayed with me throughout the years . The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards . Slaptick is his forte ' after all . Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen . The sets and the scenes are wonderful . The characters are appealing . I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them . I wish she sang to me in Vietnam . I also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the WWI music . I was glad when the DVD arrived . Now I can whistle in the dark watching it again and again .
This is an excellent film , full of complexity , themes and great dialogue . The characters are well drawn , with Phil the biggest loser of all time . < br / > < br / > Adam Haddrick's character is the most vicious thing I've seen on screen since Alec Guinness's portrayal of Adolf Hitler in ' Hitler : The Last Ten Days . ' < br / > < br / > I just wish they'd all got away with it . But without giving too much away , there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of .
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie . Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character , but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his . There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead . The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan , not his son . Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things . The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father .
Yash Raj films are so funny , whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house ? < br / > < br / > Seeing Bhatt films working they copied the formula , bikini and everything plus casting low actors like Uday and Tanishaa < br / > < br / > The film is so horrible it makes you cringe < br / > < br / > the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them Uday resembles a gay plus a monkey < br / > < br / > Tanishaa resembles an idiot < br / > < br / > The director thinks we all are idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted Music is saving grace Camera-work is good < br / > < br / > Uday Chopra hams like an idiot , Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying der then Tanishaa is worse the rest are okay
If you had a mother that described you like that , you just might be looking to bump her off yourself . It's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey , it's just how to put the plan in action . < br / > < br / > And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea . That and a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train which gives DeVito the idea to switch murders with Crystal who hates his wife , Kate Mulgrew , who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write , but is also carrying on with hunky Tony Ciccone . < br / > < br / > Throw Momma From The Train plays out kind of like Strangers On A Train as DeVito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme . But Crystal's having a bit of a problem putting Ramsey down even with Danny's help . That woman might need killing , but she's going to take a lot of it . < br / > < br / > The only Academy recognition that Throw Momma From The Train got was an Academy Award nomination for Anne Ramsey for Best Supporting Actress . Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck , but the film turned out to be her finest hour . Ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year , but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after Throw Momma From The Train , she worked right up to the end . < br / > < br / > I've seen interviews with both of the stars of Throw Momma From The Train , Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito , and both have gladly conceded that Anne Ramsey's performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them . Their acknowledgment of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute . < br / > < br / > If Marion Lorne in Strangers On A Train had been anything like Anne Ramsey here , Farley Granger would gladly have joined Robert Walker in disposing of her . Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies out there , should not be missed .
Oh , boy , it's another comet-hitting-the-earth film . Coming within a year or two of Deep Impact , Armageddon , Space Cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them , you'd think people would be burned out on this concept . Apparently not , since I rented it , hoping it MIGHT not be awful : Dennis Hopper was in it , after all , and he's a good actor , right ? < br / > < br / > I forgot something important : along with Peter O'Toole , Robert De Niro and quite a few other esteemed actors , Hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films . Not only that , but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes . His performance in Tychus is so awful that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes . < br / > < br / > I don't know what else to say about this rubbish , other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films , watch Deep Impact , and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys at a stretch . Forget the others altogether . This one really is bottom of the pile .
I saw this Hallmark television movie when it originally aired . I lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch . I just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film . But Hallmark stands for the best , quality films . Now , there is a reason to give this film a second look . Clive Owen who plays " Damon Wildeve " just might have a chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it on . Clive Owen might have to wait until the year 2008 . The other reason is the female lead is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity ( she was an unknown at the time ) and became an Academy Award winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003 . Joan Plowright as " Mrs . Yeobright " is also in this film . I like the opening line in this film : " Deliver my heart from this fearful , lonely place . Send me a great love from somewhere or else I shall die , truly I shall die . "
This show is brilliantly hilarious ! I started watching in 2007 , and had never heard of it before then . After one episode , I was hooked . I'm never home to watch it , so my wife bought me the entire series on DVD . Non stop laughs , need I say more ? I wish it was still on TV , because it is definitely worthy and a whole lot better of crap on currently on TV . < br / > < br / > I wish they would make a movie , seriously , who wouldn't go see it . Kevin James's name alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie , the guy is ( make your stomach hurt ) funny . < br / > < br / > Just a really good , down to earth , believable show . If you have the chance to buy it on DVD , do it , its worth it .
Four Friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations , only to find yourself knocked for a loop . You sort of file it away , but then you hear the song " Georgia On My Mind " by Ray Charles , and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness , and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry , almost at the same time . < br / > < br / > Why is this film so memorable ? First , at least for people who lived through it all , because it captures so well the tenor of the times - its dashed hopes , its successes , its sincerity and above all the emotional roller-coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia . And then , the acting is just so amazing . Danilow , all angst and passion , Georgia , as difficult to grasp as a will ' o the wisp ... but enchanting , nevertheless , and Louis , the handicapped room-mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile , because he knows only too well that it just might be his last . < br / > < br / > How long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story ? Even if they were far from perfect ? The film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable , but the film never moralizes , it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety ... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history , which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top ... because that's the way life is , when you think about it . And why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character . Truly an amazing and satisfying experience .
It's fun and fast paced , as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable , surprising conclusion . The suspense separates this Holiday flick from all others . One wonders how the pieces are going to fit , both during the movie and in the future . < br / > < br / > The character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process . Sinkewicz ( Frank Jenks ) shows us what manipulation can get ... and ultimately what manipulation can cost ! Uncle Felix ( S . Z . Sakall ) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect " Lishka " ( Barbara Stanwyck ) , and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end . < br / > < br / > If we could ever achieve a perfect world , imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these . < br / > < br / > A glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch . I've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store . < br / > < br / > Watch it , and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere !
Okay , < br / > < br / > I realize that there are some doubting Thomas's out there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this masterpiece of celluloid . < br / > < br / > All I can say is that the scene in which George Wendt gets sucked out of the spaceship BY HIS A * * left me trembling . I sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed , screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table thinking about it . If the director is reading this ... I would pay to be an extra in the sequel .
I don't believe it ... Luc Besson is not only a genius now ... he has always been one ... this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films ... just perfect !
I would just like to say that The Cure was a fabulious movie to help inform how people who are HIV positive have to function in life . Expecially a young boy who cant go to school because he could contaminate someone . and the ignorance of the boys who called them FAGGOTS . that just shows how much children are not educated about aids .
I absolutely love this show ! ! ! , Its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons ( cau'se lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9 . It's political , irrational , and irresistible . Anyone who says they don't like it is lying , There is a character for every one . Peter , Stewie , & Quagmire are my favorites . Peter because he is rude , obnoxious , and just doesn't give a crap . Stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it . And quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes . Also there is an episode for everybody too . If you're the political type there is Mr . Griffin goes to Washington ( VOL . 2 SEASON 3 ) . If you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible ( VOL . 2 SEASON 3 . ) . Or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit Janet ( VOL . 1 SEASON 2 ) . Basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone . GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOO !
Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park got Corman-ized . As usual the plot is wafer thin , from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are , to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs ( I've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes ) . And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film . All the male actors are imbeciles ( thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert , constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill ) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredrick's of Hollywood . The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins ( from the movie of the same name ) , it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the " motion " shots . If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST 3K style , this is gold . If you want competent film making and good acting ... don't watch a Roger Corman film . Acting gets a 4 out 10 , some of the players upon this stage did try . Story gets a 2 out of 10 , it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad . Special effects gets a 2 out of 10 , I've seen worse , but not many .
This film played in Lexington KY for 7 days . I saw it on the last day of its run & regretted that I could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience . The aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck--almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days . I just cringe to think that more people won't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater ; the DVD experience will not be the same . Here's an idea : if you live in a college town , see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival .
Interesting plot but painfully dull . The script lacks ... lacks acting . To me this film compares with " Made for TV " type movies . I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn . I watched this film with my family . It is fairly safe to watch with your kids . ( only 1 semi sex scene ) If you wish to see a young Meg Ryan ... check out this movie . Very 80 - ish . You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas , booze , super glue and tar . Or maybe you are like me ... and have have a higher standard for acting in films . However I did like the way the movie began and ended ! Mark .
For a good take on the Roman Empire watch the excellent BBC produced miniseries " I , Claudius " . This just sucked . The acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera . Hans Matheson was irritating . Cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings . Even Caligula was tame . I think this film was silently supported by " religious " groups who shall remain nameless ;) . The overt tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint . Stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe . < br / > < br / > Italy has done better - don't let Hans cute face fool you . He is not a great actor ... he is a great bore .
So many of us who are devoted to the " art " of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures . Most of the time , they are far too costly to produce to be anything else . In light of this , it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then . Once in a while , the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this . I'd like to know precisely how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some major critics " gunning " for the picture when it is at last released . Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are viewing . < br / > < br / > You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect , but magnificent ' 62 re-make 0f " Mutiny on the Bounty " , and you can definitely see it in the reaction to " Heaven's Gate " . Cimino took too long and cost United Artists way too much money in making this picture . The company was fatally wounded by his excesses and , no doubt , powerful people were out to see his reputation forever ruined when this strange , mammoth epic was finally released . There are always many film-goers who dislike long , weighty pictures . The storytelling in this film is not accomplished with great economy or a brisk pace . Like Stanley Kubrick , Cimino often chooses not to spell out the particular statement he is making with a given scene . Rather , he draws it out in such a way as to make the viewer feel like they are living in the moment , providing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented . A lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach . They want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this sort of film . These factors doubtless contributed to the box-office failure of " Heaven's Gate " . < br / > < br / > By nature , a film editor , I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film . Here and there , a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness . Then we come to the massive , drawn-out battle scenes at the end of the picture . Where these are concerned , the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged . If you liked the film up to the point where these occur , your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is likely to become unclear and this is indeed a frustration . Not having seen all the rough footage , I can not tell if actual re-shoots would have been needed , or whether some critical plot elements might have been made clearer by careful re-editing of some moments . Given the time and money that were poured into this picture , more care and thought should have been given to this problem . < br / > < br / > There are other problems , some occasional weak acting , some dialog that doesn't ring true , but these are really minor concerns . The reason I am so troubled by the problems stated above is that , like so many these days , I too feel that in all " Heaven's Gate " is so splendid to behold and so magnificently deals with major historic , political and sociological issues that it is just short of a masterpiece . Despite its shortcomings , it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other Hollywood films I have ever seen . I'd like to re-mix a lot of the sound . I'd like to re-direct and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed , but the greatness of this picture is such that these considerations really do become trivial when compared with the value of the total production . I should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the glorious effect that it is so capable of delivering .
The brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven , and occasionally distasteful comedy , which was snatched back from release after only a few days . Drunken , lecherous Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson accidentally sets an Arab potentate on fire at the UN and is posted to his tiny country as punishment , arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader ( American soap star Thaao Penghlis ) on the throne . Sir Les , with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage ( Both played by Humphries ) almost accidentally foils a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly , disgusting , AIDS-like virus on the Western World . Joan Rivers has a cameo as the female President of the United States , her desk plate reading " President Rivers " ! Extreme bad taste mingles with slapstick and Humphries ' usual scathing satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it's many funny parts , than taken together as a whole . Dame Edna's TV fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different Madge Allsop , sadly , one who lacks Emily Perry's wonderful drab comedy magic in the role . The film was written By Humphries & his third wife , Diane Millstead , and directed by the Mad Max man himself , George Miller . For die-hard Humphries fans like myself , essential . All others , beware .
A 2006 online poll of Japan's top 100 favorite animated television series of all time , conducted by TV Asahi , placed this series in fourth place . That tells you everything you need to know . So go and watch it . ;) I won't comment on the story , simply because I don't want to ruin anything . I only urge you to keep watching after you saw the first episode . The Animation is really good and above TV average . The best thing about this series is , that there is finally something new . I mean it's not groundbreaking but still it offers a fresh new idea and likable characters . You won't regret entering Suzumiya Haruhi's world . < br / > < br / > and the best thing a movie is coming soon
I saw this film last night , a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment . < br / > < br / > What can I say . I absolutely hated it . About as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments . < br / > < br / > Maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the Survivor and Big Brother type shows , but if this had been a video / DVD or if I'd been watching at the cinema on my own I would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes . < br / > < br / >
Twins Effect , starring some of HK's most popular stars provides one of the most enjoyable film experiences to come out of HK in sometime . It has something for everyone , action , comedy , horror , romance , and some drama . This film can't be taken too seriously , otherwise you'd go in dissapointed , but if you leave your brain at the door , and just watch the film for some fun , you're bound to enjoy it . < br / > < br / > Great special effects , excellent action , cute Twins , cool HK actors , FUN film ! < br / > < br / > I'd recommend it to anyone !
Despite the famous cast this animated version of Dickens tale is the borest I've seen . Enough that I zapped away in he first commercial break . The characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap . < br / > < br / > I'll give this movie a very low rating . Give me the Disney version anytime .
While this is horribly dated , I MUST insist ... PLEASE , NO REMAKE ! Frankly , it just won't help , as there's nothing which could be added or changed , contemporarily , to make this cinematically better . < br / > < br / > The novel upon which this is based , was atmospheric , well written , truly spooky work , but on film , it just doesn't translate . Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film . I'm not sure why this is , but when you view this work , if you view it , you are likely to see just what I mean . < br / > < br / > The book ? It's wonderful . It's not a masterpiece , but it's more than just entertaining . < br / > < br / > The movie ? Do something else . You can thank me later . < br / > < br / > It rates a 3.1 / 10 from ... < br / > < br / > the Fiend : .
This is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007 . < br / > < br / > The tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told . < br / > < br / > Beautifully shot , and scripted - from childhood to the adulthood it never falters . < br / > < br / > A brilliant insight into a lost culture , and a very good way to understand Farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right . It is both compassionate and thrilling , uplifting and filled with immense sorrow , joyful and depressing . < br / > < br / > With excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best . < br / > < br / > Highest recommendation : a real slice of life that uplifts and informs .
Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict . He's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person . The only film with him in it that is enjoyable is " Galaxy Quest " and that just because his character - a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit TV show - was so close to real life for him . The rest of the cast is equally bad . I HATE the mother and the actress that played her Patricia Richardson , she sucks ! Ever cliché is there , the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children , while in real life she's proclaims family values and gets divorced after having twins . And the child actors were about as interesting as a root canal .
This is the absolutely worst show in the history of Nickelodeon . First of all , no boarding school has a Sushi Bar , Flat screen TVs , and gives every student a laptop . This makes the show so unrealistic , and boring . The plots are pointless , and incredibly boring . The actors are so bad , it makes me want to take my own life . I really hate the fact that in the show , Zoey is the most popular girl in school , and the prettiest , and smartest , and gets the best grades without doing any work . She never has any real problems , and every guy wants to date her . She is so perfect . There isn't anyone like that . Also , I hate that everyone would do anything for her , and everyone picks her for every team , or club . It is so annoying . Quinn is so obnoxious . Her experiments are pathetic , pointless , and fake . Chase is such a wimp . He says he loves Zoey , but if he told her , it would ruin their friendship . How pathetic . Michael tries to be funny , but he never accomplishes anything . Nichole is so perky , and screams a lot . She is never seen doing any work , or studying , but she is a straight A student . Lola thinks she is an actress , but she sucks ( Excuse my language ) . Need I say more ? I think no . For your own good , stay away from this show at all costs .
This movie just was not very funny . There's not much else to say , other than that it was kind of embarrassing for Laurence Fishburne and David Hyde Pierce , both of whom deserve much better than this . Also , I don't understand why , after this movie completely and utterly bombed , WB insisted on making it into a TV show .
Chick Flick ? Of course ... Been done before ? Many times ... Predictable ? Yes ... Worth watching ? You bet ! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line . I am a great fan of mother / daughter stories . What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development . Although this is not the BEST of its genre , I will buy it and watch it again . I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior .
Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work , handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual , but the entire family . Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood sappy endings , Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way . < br / > < br / > Highest praise goes David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances . I had presumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous on screen relationship in Blackpool bleed through - - but it never does . Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work , and I didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes . In addition , Harry Treadaway's performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic - throughout the piece , he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house , < br / > < br / > At times , nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic . As the viewer , I wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality , stop moping , and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives . But under the same circumstances , I see myself acting like any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything , including behavior that is completely unlike myself . It's the show's greatest strength - truth , without sugar coating , to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances . < br / > < br / > This is a difficult , but must-watch show . I hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the U . S .
THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ! The Decline of Western Civilization ... what a great title eh ? And of coarse a great movie . This is the best concert film I have ever seen . A close second being the Talking Heads movie " Stop Making Sense " . I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992 . I looked at the director's name Penelope Spheeris and thought cool name , what else has he directed ? I thought the first name was pronounced like envelope . After some time looking in movie guides I came across the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope was a woman ... my Mom corrected me . I spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down . I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver , where I currently reside . It was worth the wait . This captures the LA punk movement very well . This is teen angst at it's best folks . My favourite is the band the Germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because Darby Crash sings so crazy , you cannot understand it . I laughed when I saw this . The band Black Flag live in an abandoned church and the band X are a very intelligent bunch . Also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whales , there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in ! I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after this , and saw all her punk movies-Dudes was OK , and Suburbia is a cult classic ! I own both of these on VHS . She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff . I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular . I was a big Nirvana fan then , but alas I saw this in 2002 and by that point I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim . Quite a change of pace , I know , but what can you do ? But if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything . Much better than 1991 : The Year Punk Broke . This is a tough movie to track down , but if you get your hands on it , rent it , even if you don't like the music it is an excellent piece of work . Now days it might be easier to find with DVD's being so popular . By the way Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks movie called " Real Life " which I also own . Very funny stuff in todays reality TV craptacular ! Rent Decline ... Highly recommended ! Thanks !
Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company , Filmation on the back of He-man : Masters of the universe and She-Ra : Princess of Power , in 1983 and 87 ' respectively . The plot of the cartoon was about a Native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr , who possesses the strength of the bear , ears of the wolf , speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk , and his trusty sidekick , a talking horse named Thirty - Thirty , who carried with him a gun aptly titled , ' Sarah Jane ' and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge J . B serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of outlaws . < br / > < br / > Set in futuristic Texas , this was and still is to this day , one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city , in the US - hence in the South - thousands of light years ahead in the future . Considering this was made in the 80s , the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a Sci-Fi based outlook . Bravestarr didn't just evoke morality and good verses bad , as well as teaching children lessons about life , but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn't take things and life for granted . And despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon , many of the story lines , themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them . In addition , Marshall Bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ( ethnic ) minority background , to make an impact on TV . < br / > < br / > The sound effects were amazing , the music was great , the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful . The characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong . Something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons , sadly . < br / > < br / > Whilst Bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of He-man , it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics . Suffice to say , I preferred Bravestarr over He-man because of the diversity of the story lines , characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves , were more what I would say realistic and identifiable in contrast . For some reason , they resonated more with people because like for instance , in ' The Pledge ' where a kid dies from a drug overdose , the fact that there wasn't a happy ending was important - in the sense that when kids watch that episode , well , in fact anyone who watches that episode , will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs . < br / > < br / > Bold , brave and at times thought-provoking , Bravestarr is definitely that - bold , brave and thought provoking . A cult cartoon classic for many years to come , it dared to take some risks , but it had well and truly paid off in the end . It will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever , and rightly so < br / > < br / > 8 and a half out of ten
Slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot . Special ops team is sent into south America to hunt down blood sucking natives . Their leader is a real old man who has aged well . There's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers . Lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film . It looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood . While each member of the cast brought their own talents , it really didn't all click as a film . The effects were OK , except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires . If you're looking for lots of blood and violence , this is for you .
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military . When a flaw is discovered , he is issued to be deprogrammed . Rather than face death , he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America , where he takes refuge in a village . The military chases him into there , leading into a big action feast . < br / > < br / > Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android . His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done . Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero . And it works out ; the action scenes aren't that spectacular , but they aren't all too bad either . The acting from the other characters is pretty bad , but I was not expecting anything too good . The special effects were decent as well . < br / > < br / > Solo is decent as an action flick , but very forgettable . It lacks the substance that most movies possess . But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking , this will get the job done .
There were nice characters in here , played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses , plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers ... yet the film just didn't work . By the time this was almost over , I was bored to death . The dialog was dumb , the humor ( mainly Milton Berle's ) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley . < br / > < br / > I've never been a big-band fan , anyway , and if I hear " In The Mood " one more time I'll puke . < br / > < br / > This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her . Almost part of the problem , at least with the humor , is that it's so dated it isn't funny anymore . Berle , Phil Silvers , Bob Hope , Red Skeleton , Abbot & Costello , etc . etc . were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes , and what was funny back then is not today .
There's nothing new in this movie . Nothing you haven't thought about before , nothing you haven't heard before . The story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways , and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one . One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isn't neither a movie nor a documentary . The director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie . The result is weird . And finally , I read in previous comments that stated that people who don't like this movie are anti-gay . I'm pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie . This is a funny world .
Yes , I know , Roscoe Arbuckle didn't like to be called ' Fatty ' , but I couldn't resist the joke . < br / > < br / > This is a fine Lloyd Hamilton short from his peak period , directed by Roscoe . The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner . Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting . Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor , as well as a talented comedian . < br / > < br / > This story plays with some interesting themes , like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG : here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them . Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off .
The only reason I rated this film as 2 is because Channing Tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch . Usually I adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time , I didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all . I'm no film critic but I just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see Channing Tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it ( not that his acting was any good ) I would have stopped watching much quicker . It's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker . .. If you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in ... give this one a miss ! !
This is the second movie about 1985 , the other one was ' The Wedding Singer ' . Whilst the ' Wedding Singer ' was portraying the pop side of the 80 ' s , ' Rock Star ' is all about metal . < br / > < br / > Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend . When his fixation rewards him , his whole life changes in a day . < br / > < br / > The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star . Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie , but it is full of Rock'n Roll ! The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly ! The whole concert feeling is very well captured , since they used real audiences ( no cgi here ) . < br / > < br / > Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark , who acts like a true metal dude ! < br / > < br / > ' Rock Star ' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene , you are going to love this movie ! < br / > < br / > 10/10
Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . This is simply a " run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc " slasher , but without the passion that graced the original . < br / > < br / > There's nothing new in the story , in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether . Here , the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and , naturally , kill most of the residents in grisly fashion . The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around . Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons , in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse . You don't care about these characters , AT ALL . The plot is nonexistent , the music poor ( apart from one Simon Boswell song ) , it's not scary in the least ; it's just not that good . < br / > < br / > Easily the worst film Dario Argento has been involved with and Lamberto Bava's also ( Bava has a cameo in this film , not a very funny one ) . < br / > < br / > Maybe 3 is too high a rating , but at least I could watch it all and didn't think of stopping midway . My advice ; Stick to the original .
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a ' rehab patient ' ( ? ) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight ( as seen from the previous episodes ) . < br / > < br / > Anyway , this last episode is really suspended . The ending is not so understandable . I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming . < br / > < br / > I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear / hanging events that were happened . < br / > < br / > Just can't wait further for season 3 .
Wow , " The Curse of Michael Myers " what a great film . Suspenseful , entertaining , creative and a clever plot which I love . Many hate the ' Thorn ' concept , I love it . I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot . Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance , especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are great also . My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this film as Jamie ? She wanted to return , but the producers said no . I thought J . C Brandy was great , but I love Danielle Harris . Still , I love Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers . I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and George P . Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever . Incredibly creepy and suspenseful , Halloween 6 rules ! < br / > < br / > I adore this very violent , but immensely enjoyable film . The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the Genre . < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10 .
I wasn't expecting to much of this movie when I went into the theater but I had been waiting for it for many years . To sum it up , it was pretty damn good ! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good , I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong . Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt . He played the bad guy too well , I mean he was sick , sadistic , and very cruel . The back story between the brothers was good , plus I liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film . It gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die . Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of CMM . I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead , it was better then just him being like , " Whatever , my buddy is dead , who cares " . It showed how he really cared . So overall , this was a darn god slasher with some great effects . Bravo !
Sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a Looney Tunes featurette than a grisly giallo , " Don't Torture a Duckling " ( 1972 ) is nonetheless a Grade A thriller from horror maestro Lucio Fulci . In this one , someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural , southern Italian village and , typical for these gialli , there are many suspects . There's Barbara Bouchet ( Patrizia ) , looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her , a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal ; Florinda Bolkan ( Martiara ) , the local epileptic voodoo woman ; her witchcraft-practicing beau ; Giuseppe , the local idiot ; the sweet-faced priest ; his dour mother ; and on and on . The film features some unusually violent set pieces , including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard ( one of the most realistically bloody sequences that I've ever seen ) and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed . The film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of . Still , this giallo fascinates , with its unusual rural backdrop , unsettling child murders , oddball characters , and freaky score by Riz Ortolani . The film has been beautifully photographed in what I presume to be Monte Sant'Angelo , near the Adriatic in southern Italy ( at least , that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits ) . And while subtitling would've made this fine-looking DVD work even better ( the American slang doesn't convince in this rural Italian setting ) , Anchor Bay is to be thanked for another job well done . Oh ... that title DOES eventually make perfect sense , too !
Warner Brothers tampered considerably with American history in " Big Trail " director Raoul Walsh's first-rate western " They Died with Their Boots On , " a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer . The film chronicles Custer from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn . This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics . Walsh and Flynn teamed in quite often afterward , and " They Died with Their Boots On " reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time . They appeared as a couple in seven previous films . This 140 - minute , black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences , humorous romantic scenes , and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries . One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sheridan who is shown as the commandant at West Point before the Civil War . Indeed , Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point . In fact , the commandant was Robert E . Lee as the earlier Flynn film " Santa Fe Trail " showed . Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott ; Scott was not the commander of Union troops throughout the Civil War . Warner Brothers presented Custer as a drinker ( probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking ) , but in real life Custer neither drank nor smoked . Nevertheless , these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film . < br / > < br / > " They Died with Their Boots On " opens with Custer riding into West Point Military Academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an African-American carrying his luggage and tending his dogs . After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general , the sergeant turns Custer over to a ranking cadet Ned Sharp ( Arthur Kennedy of " City for Conquest " ) to take charge of him . Sharp plays a practical job on Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe ( Stanley Ridges of " Task Force " ) who promptly runs Custer out . Naturally , the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public brawl . General Phil Sheridan ( John Litel of " The Sons of Katie Elder " ) is prepared to dismiss Custer from West Point for conduct unbecoming . As it turns out , Sheridan cannot expel Custer because Custer has not enrolled . Once he enrolls , Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore . When the American Civil War erupts , West Point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat . One of the last cadets hustled off to war is Custer . Avid as he is to get into the fight , Custer encounters his future wife , Elizabeth ' Libby ' Bacon ( Olivia de Havilland of " Santa Fe Trail " ) , and they pledge themselves to each other , despite Mr . Bacon ( Gene Lockhart of " Carousel " ) who detests the sight of Custer . It seems that Bacon ran across Custer at a saloon and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero reprimanded Bacon . < br / > < br / > Meanwhile , back in Washington , Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment , but Major Taipe has him cooling his heels . Custer befriends rotund Lieutenant General Winfield Scott ( Sidney Greenstreet of " The Maltese Falcon " ) and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that becomes one of Custer's characteristics . Not only does Scott see to it that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry , but also Custer appropriates Taipe's horse to get to his command . During the Battle of Bull Run , 21 July 1861 , Custer disobeys orders from none other than Sharp , strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it . Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital , Custer receives a medal rather than a court-martial . When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg , in Pennsylvania , Scott is shocked by the chance that the South may triumph . When a brigadier general cannot be found , Scott goads Taipe into promoting the first available officer . A mistake is made and Custer is promoted . Incredulous at first , Custer embraces the moment and cracks Stuart's advance . After the war , Custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons . Sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist Custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds . Eventually , Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan , who was in command of the army , and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry . When he takes command , Custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that Sharp commands the liquor at the fort . Meanwhile , Custer has his first run in with Crazy Horse ( Anthony Quinn of " The Guns of Navarone " ) and takes him into custody . Of course , Crazy Horse escapes , becomes Custer's adversary , and they fight . < br / > < br / > Once Custer has quelled Crazy Horse and the Indians , Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations . They also see to it that Custer is brought up on charges for striking Taipe in a saloon brawl . On his way to Washington , Custer discovers the perfidy of Sharp and Taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred Black Hills . Settlers rampage in and the Indians hit the warpath . Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins . " Stagecoach " lenser Bert Glennon captures both the grit and the glory . The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular . As an added premonition of Custer's imminent demise , Libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the Little Big Horn . " They Died with Their Boots On " benefits from a top-notch Max Steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune " Gary Owen . "
This little film brings back a lot of memories , both fond and foul , of what can and does happen when one is a working musician . The not so pleasant accommodations for the band , the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play , the sheer ecstasy of the applause ... Far from being farcical it is , in fact , very accurate in the way it depicts musicians , professional and otherwise , who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue . There are those times when everything goes perfectly , there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home . In the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out .
This good-guy-vs-the-evil-tyrant story , set in 19th century Russia , may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves ' career beyond those " Hercules " movies . However , despite the different costumes , it's still a " Hercules " movie with the usual stilted dialog , haphazard dubbing , and cardboard characters . On the other hand , there's lots of action , the pace rarely flags , and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist , bound with ropes , and given a vigorous whipping which , needless to say , has little effect on his defiant character .
The only reason I gave this episode of " Masters of Horror " a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good , and it wasn't shot on VHS . The story , the dialog , and the plot are ridiculous . < br / > < br / > Talking / Driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war ! Give me a break ! What next , zombies who come back to go skydiving ? Maybe zombies who come back to host QVC shows ? < br / > < br / > I never supported the Iraq war , but I do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces ; and " Homecoming " was disrespectful in that it mocks the TRUE horror of war . < br / > < br / > With zombies being mass produced in today's market ... this is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment . How " Homecoming " made it onto " Masters of Horror " is beyond me .
The only reason I watched this movie a second time , was to learn the name of the " second banana " girl playing opposite Katie Holms . Her name is Marisa Coughlan . Never heard of her before . She is lovely . Captivating . With an animated face , and cute bod , she is highly watchable ... She's got real , " Poisenality " ... More than a passing vibe of Grace Kelly ... with youthful exuberance . I think she is Irish in gene pool , ( my favorite female DNA ) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful Irish American . The movie is unremarkable , Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh . But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes . In 1999 when this movie was made , she was around 25 years old , in her prime . This reminds me of another silly , worthless movie with the only redemption being the Pretty Girl in it . It was " Career Opportunites " with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly . Or " Grease II " the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer .
This show is amazing ! I love each and every episode . Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a lovable and at times a moron . Arthur , Spence , Danny , Deacon and Carrie's Boss add just a nice end touch to the show , tying up all of the funny , pee in your pants moments . In one of the seasons , Doug tries to get Carrie drunk , because she is nicer when she is drunk . Nice husband right ? Carrie isn't much better , when her boss needs a IPS driver to testify in a small case at her job , Carrie hesitates , because she views Doug as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her , so she hires Doug's friend instead . Wife of the year . But , who i believe to be funniest is yell-at-random Arthur . He is drop-dead hilarious , and angry . Hey , you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy . This show is hilarious , and if you haven't seen it yet , then you haven't lived !
I don't know how I would feel if I lived in USA . I would watch some preview scenes , advertisements , I would know , Sidney Pollack directed it , Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring in . I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review . Would I be disappointment ? < br / > < br / > I read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was : This is boring , long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting . Harrison is wooden , cold . The sublots should be cut . Too serious , particularly for Harrison Ford . I am interested in the subject , and I like Harrison Ford in the films which are not actions . I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too . So reading the reviews on IMDB website then in other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wonder and wonder what the film was . Anyway there are films , directors , stars what / who I want to see despite any reviews . < br / > < br / > I can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion , but I feel different . It is true I liked Sliding Doors , The Forbidden Woman ( this is a French film , I don't know what its title in English , or in French ) . Basic of these films is development of a love . < br / > < br / > I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way . < br / > < br / > It may be true that the sublots - the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman - are not written well , are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.After his wife's death and betrayal emotion , angry of Dutch comes to the surface during his work . He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend ( then the woman too ) . The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy : our wife / husband's death and cheating . One of them is the woman's : this is tragedy , but the life is continuing . She doesn't want to mourn forever . What she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife - thought about her she will not learn never . She is forced to behave in this way . The elections are comes , and anything about his husband may become scandal . She wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father . The man is a cop.He suffering from the fact he lived in lies . He wants to know - maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him . How long had she got lover ? . He needs the woman's help but she doesn't want , but the guy is stubborn and steady / persistent . The woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget . Their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world , the tragedy . ( I said it in spite of that they made love in bed ) However the cop , can't stop with investigation , can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the " love " , and the woman wants their relationship to continue . But it can't . The woman realizes it . The end is a bit sad , but logic , and nice at the same time . < br / > < br / > It was pleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I like this man's face - Sidney Pollack . I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good . < br / > < br / > I think Harrison Ford did an okay job . His eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally I believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament . It was pity he had not got any joke . But Ford has got a good sense of humour . A reviewer noticed ( in Hungary ): " Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice . But Dr Jones is not smiling at us " .. But he smiles at the end and it is sooo good . With the rest I agree . I very like him in this role - He is good in acting of this a bit rough , cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop .. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined , self confident , but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions . But she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.The two cool , reserved - people find each other . < br / > < br / > Maybe the script is not good . It is full of common , banal sentence , but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man . It is a good film but not for everybody , not for the general big audience . I watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better . About the latter , maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex . Anyway I advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes , who like only Ford's action films miss this movie .
My original comment on this particular title was deleted , by a IMDb user or the staff , only because I just happen to dislike this film to the point I had to sincerely write what I felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film . where's my freedom of word ? < br / > < br / > Obviously this movie was made by students , ' cos so lame and amateurish it felt . Of course even they have to start from somewhere ? The script was incoherent mess and so was the acting . With low budget and b - class actors , what can you expect ? There's some CGI in places , so poor , it looks like done with an old PC . Some may say , this is sort of an " Alien " clone , only this time it's Dracula ( in a vintage costume ) who's sucking the other cast dry , one by one . The sets are unconvincing , cheap and small ( boiler rooms ) , although the story takes place in a large space craft . < br / > < br / > It would be fun to know what the stars ( Erika Eleniak , Casper Van Dien , Coolio and Udo Kier ) thought about the film after it was released ... Coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever ! < br / > < br / > It was a total waste of my time and money , don't know why I even bothered to rent this flick . Honestly , I just hate this film . With Uwe Boll's House Of The Dead , Dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever . ( Well , I've seen even worse than these two ) < br / > < br / > Avoid ! Any other film will do better .
This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M ( Dog Gone Tired ) . An escaped convict ( here just known as Joe ) who just broke out of ' Alka Fizz Prison ' tries to keep one step ahead of Droopy ( known here as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties ) , but always manages to run into him , one way or another . This is easily one of the most side splitting , funny shorts that rolled out of the M-G-M animation studio . It manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions Joe has whenever he encounters McPoodle ( including some equally deranged sound effects-i . e .. car horns , screaming , elephants , etc . ) . As with any Avery M-G-M short , frantic , kinetic pacing is to be expected ( along with some nice , surreal sight gags-i.e.Joe trying to run away from McPoodle & actually running off the side of the film ) . Pop this one into your DVD player & laugh yourself silly .
A gem of a British caper-comedy . Poor American schlub Pinky Green ( Richard Jordan , playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one ) gets out of a British jail and tries to go straight , but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends , headed up by a really nasty Ivan ( David Niven in one of his last roles ) . Pinky resists , but the lure of all that money is just too much for him . Things unravel and reravel and it's all joyous to watch . Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career , but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate . Niven never played a slicker bad guy , oil all over . Two fine actors we've lost that I wish we had back .
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen . 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by . the characters were very believable and entertaining , and the photography was excellent . the story pulled me in and held my attention . i will definitely watch this again and again . this true story telling at it's best ... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz . i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie . most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise . basically , it's a great film that received unfairly harsh reviews . watch it for yourself with an open mind . if you like westerns , historic period pieces , albeit historically inaccurate you'll enjoy the movie . Superb ! ! ! 10/10
A remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best ; to remake a true classic , especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock , is something else again . And after watching this version of ` Psycho , ' directed by Gus Van Sant , two things come to mind immediately : What's the point , and what on earth were they thinking ? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same screenplay ( by Joseph Stefano , taken from the novel by Robert Bloch ) that Hitchcock used . The final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking : First , that a ` remake ' should be just that ; a retooling of the original , rather than a ` copy ' using new players ; and second , that shooting in color , using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film . Although this was a noble effort by Van Sant , ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which Norma Bates was afflicted : The ` mind ' of the film was divided ; half was Hitchcock , half Van Sant . And the twain , though met , shall never be bound . Van Sant , even working from the original script , would have been better off making his own film - - all the way through - - rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes . The opening shot of the movie , for instance , and especially the ` shower ' scene , arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema . Copying Hitchcock , from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain , and using the same ` skree ! skree ! skree ! ' sound effects - - even as homage to Hitchcock - - again , only distracted from the story . And , if you factor in the performance of William H . Macy ( as Private Eye Arbogast ) , you have yet another split in the psyche of the film . Macy is a terrific actor - - one of the best character actors in the business - - and his performance here is excellent ; but as good as it is , the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet ( with whom he has worked many times ) , and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant is doing . So the film winds up with a triple personality disorder : Hitchcock , Van Sant and Mamet . I felt like I was watching ` House Of Good Will Psycho Games . ' < br / > < br / > As far as performances go , Macy's was as solid as they come , and Anne Heche ( Marion Crane ) did a good job of creating an original character , escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh . The weak links were Viggo Mortensen ( Sam ) , who made Marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place ; and Vince Vaughn , who--to put it as delicately as possible - - was simply awful as Norman Bates . His whole performance was that of an actor playing a role ( and not very convincingly at that ); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with ` spontaneous ' bursts of maniacal laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character , altogether unbelievable and pretentious . It gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a ` True Incident ' you would see on a television show ; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from Norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced Peter Graves , intoning , ` Such was the mind-set of Norman Bates on that fateful , rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of her car and into his life - - ' The supporting cast includes Julianne Moore ( Lila ) , Robert Forster ( Dr . Simon ) , Philip Baker Hall ( Sheriff Al Chambers ) , Anne Haney ( Mrs . Chambers ) , Chad Everett ( Tom Cassidy ) , Rance Howard ( Mr . Lowery ) , Rita Wilson ( Caroline ) , James Remar ( Patrolman ) and James LeGros ( Charlie the Car Dealer ) . If nothing else , Van Sant's ` Psycho ' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director , a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success . Granted , todays era of psycho-babble , ` American Psycho ' and Hannibal Lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like Norman Bates somewhat ; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman , his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying ; but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of dread , that throat-clenching fear , with this film . If ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight-to-video , this is it . Better still , had it never been born . I rate this one 2/10
It's 2005 , my friends ... a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology . So , why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film . I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off , but this one ... it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible . Just ... don't ... watch it . I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good . I feel like a small child produced this entire movie . There's not even an original plot line . Vampire Assassins , in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself . Can someone tell me if , perhaps , this was designed as a comedy movie and I just didn't know it ? It makes me wonder , what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment ?
Wow ... not in a good way . < br / > < br / > I can't believe people dig this trash . Most of the shows on television are pretty bad , and this has been a running trend for a while now - they just keep getting worse , but Las Vegas definitely takes it home . What a terrible show ... < br / > < br / > The actors are a bunch of has-been C + losers that never went anywhere ( except James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this pos ) so its not their fault that this show sucks . They just can't help it . Blame the producers and the writers . I can't believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it .
This is probably Wayne's poorest movie ; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role . It's just incredibly bad . The editing is especially awful ; it really appears that the editor ( if there was one ) literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together . The opening has to be seen to be believed . John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned ! I know there are " B " films - but are there " H " films ? If so , this one's an example . And I say this as a devoted JW fan .
Jean Dujardin gets Connery's mannerisms down pat : the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him , the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie , the swaggering , steely gait . It's uncanny , and you come to realise just how much of Bond in the Sixties was Connery's creation and not really Ian Fleming's character . < br / > < br / > The cinematography is a nod to those early films , the movie takes off From Russia With Love and Thunderball mainly . The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is , not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism , and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to Egypt . < br / > < br / > It's not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day , of which there were plenty . Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspect-looking men in fez's following their heroes around too , and that's going back a bit . Unlike Sellers ' Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat , Dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery mannerisms . It doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song , and there's no funny or serious villain , like Mike Myers ' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis , for the hero to go up against . < br / > < br / > But the scene where OSS 117 wakes up in Cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema , and the whole thing looks wonderful , plus you'll never get a chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen , and the women are ace crumpet , really hot . It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist / Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets routine . Throughly recommended .
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school . Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end . It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay . Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle . Still , if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels . If you like senseless cookie cutter screamers , you'll like this , otherwise you should pass .
I admit to a secret admiration of the original Love Thy Neighbour TV shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but I'd be lying through my teeth ( very uncomfortable position ) if I pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination . The opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there . By the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father , moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self-righteous , ignorant rage , most discerning viewers will have switched off . Take that as a warning , unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting , static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage .
As I don't have a TV , and had never heard of this mini-series , I didn't know what to expect from The Second Coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis , which sounded interesting . < br / > < br / > Dear God ! ( Every pun intended . ) If someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play I wouldn't have been surprised . < br / > < br / > Why , oh why did they decide to portray Jesus mark II as what amounted to an idiot savant ? Is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this ? Okay , an ordinary bloke , but a Great Northern Moron . I don't think so . < br / > < br / > Apparently all Jesus did to impress people was his miracles , because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone . Certainly without the night into day stunt Mr Jesus Eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe , a paddle or any kind of following at all . < br / > < br / > And the odd little gay polemics put in willy-nilly , without rhyme or reason . Other than , of course , Russell waving to his QAF fan base . Jesus turns up in the pub to recruit ' disciples ' ( more gormless Northern losers and , of course , the gay writer's standby - the harpy woman , nag , nag , nagging away ) . Gay rights are rammed down his throat to no real purpose , almost like Russell thought he ' owed it to the lads ' to put Jesus on the spot . < br / > < br / > I can't really see the real Jesus coming out with " Well , I've nothing against it personally , mate . " Only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine Jesus to be quite this wet . < br / > < br / > And don't start me on the ending . ' Please come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if God dies ' . < br / > < br / > It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates . " Hello , I'm Bill Gates , and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style I'm going to give it all to you , my customers . " And eat the rat poison , of course . < br / > < br / > I'm often mystified by the ratings on IMDb , but the high rating on this one takes the biscuit . < br / > < br / > Never mind Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for brainless MTV lads . < br / > < br / > God help us all indeed .
Claire Booth Luce's " The Women " shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play , ( and 1939 film that also has Joan Crawford playing a bitch : a character who might have been Amanda Farrow 20 years before ) , that has no male characters . Here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are . They use women like toys and throw them away , leaving the women to suffer . Ironically , the women in " The Women " , perhaps because they are all we see , are shown in a less than favorable light , alternately silly and scheming , with the only " nice " one , ( Norma Shearer ) , growing " claws " by the end . In " The Best of Everything " we see the men for the cads they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable . < br / > < br / > This is a film about women leaping from things . Diane Baker leaps from a car , ( in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history , which is not in the book ) . Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape . The women in the film are leaping into the workplace , looking for success and love at the same time . Women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade . But they would come back to it in the 80 ' s and 90 ' s through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz , ( although their trashier works aren't as good as this ) . < br / > < br / > The best thing about this film is the way it looks . I love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50 ' s and 60 ' s . They look so much better than the pixel-challenged home movies we've been making since , especially in the letterboxed version we see on TV , and the DVD , with the picture so clear you could walk into it . The look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable . This film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other . It has a supermodel , ( Suzy Parker ) , a beauty queen , ( Myrna Hansen , who was not Miss America 1954 as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD commentary but rather Miss USA 1953 , per the IMDb : but so what ) , and a Playboy playmate , ( June Blair , from January 1957 ) . My vote goes to Suzy , one of the astonishing beauties of all time . Her acting here isn't as awful as people pretend : they are just reacting , as people did then , to the sight of a supermodel , ( the first , really ) , trying to act . Nobody seemed to care how well she did . Her role , that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable , is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine . < br / > < br / > The most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time . Hope Lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959 . Diane Baker was 20 . Suzy Parker was 26 . Hope , who looked to be Grace Kelly's heir , never made it really big and wound up being Mrs . Muir on television and , per the IMDb , wound up living in a home with " crates for coffee tables " because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age 72 in 2003 . This film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then . Baker , always a welcome face in 60 ' s TV , ( especially to Richard Kimble ) , and still active as an actress and acting coach , just turned 67 . Parker found " the best of everything " with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year Lange did . But here they are , young , beautiful and ambitious for success and love , just like their characters .
A movie this dumb should never see the light of day . The acting is lame , the violence is just all over the place , the sneaking ending is just plain stupid . < br / > < br / > It's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the R . I . C . C . O . squad . No one has never seen him , not even the hit men themselves . So he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this R . I . C . C . O . squad , before they find them . < br / > < br / > Then the movie goes on to a romance , gun shooting , and voodoo . Now how in the hell did voodoo come in this . Never see this film if your life depends on it . Trust Me ! ! !
" Opera " is a great film with some wonderful , imaginative imagery.An opera singer ( Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes.This idea of the needles comes from the fact that Argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies . " For years I've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films . I film these images because I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away.So I thought to myself ' How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes ? ' The answer I came up with is the core of what " Opera " is about . " - says Argento.Plenty of suspense , wonderful cinematography and brutal , gory murders.One guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound , Daria Nicolodi gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole , etc.For anyone who hasn't caught this one yet , give it a try.Highly recommended .
When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small Texas town , people start to die . The county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials . It turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods . < br / > < br / > I like low budget science fiction and horror movies . I like monster movies . So I thought that there would be a good chance that I would like this movie . Sadly , I didn't . < br / > < br / > I don't mind the bad acting , the corny dialog , the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has . There are a lot of movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it's good kind of way . < br / > < br / > But where others of that type and Night Fright differ is that Night Fright just has terrible pacing . And it drags on because of that . There are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening-the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time ; there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting is going on . If these scenes were shorter , the movie might not have been as boring ( though I don't think simply cutting those scenes would save this one ) . < br / > < br / > I have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that I gave it a chance before slamming it in this review . Sadly , it has gotten worse with each watch . There won't be a fourth .

With groovy tunes , inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside , this has got to be the greatest film of all time ! * * *
Paul Bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease . For that , he deserves all the credit . However , the movie was mostly about exactly that , keeping the adventures of Darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideas . < br / > < br / > Two things bothered me terribly : the soundtrack , with its whiny sound , practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer , and the movie trailer , showing some beautiful sceneries , the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith , thus misrepresenting the movie completely . < br / > < br / > To put it bluntly , if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie , the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result . Clearly , not what I expected from a movie about Darwin , albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted .
Every time I watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes . Yes , you read that correctly : I've watched this wretched , foul thing more than once . < br / > < br / > Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons : Harold Ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties , Rodney Dangerfield ( wisely ) walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script , Bill Murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it , and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better . < br / > < br / > I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling . The only conclusion I can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil . Stay with me a moment . She must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them . She may also have been extremely drunk . That's what I need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind . If I'm lucky it'll be washed out forever . < br / > < br / > I have seen this film several times . I blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim-witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility . Perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid . No , the Muppet show is funnier now ... guess I was just dull . Caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that . It WAS . It IS . It will only get worse with time . < br / > < br / > My reasons for going back to this film , mercifully , are becoming fewer . Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer . His opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle . We see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland . Randy Quaid acquits himself well , and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic , he was it . < br / > < br / > Maybe that's the trick of the movie . It has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it , are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them . Years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats . < br / > < br / > Jackie Mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness , I'm not sure he deserves it . He's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation . That's who the movie was written for but I'm not sure even he could have saved it . Ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction , bad editing ( shall we count continuity errors ? ) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing . < br / > < br / > Dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid's bulldog determination . It isn't even bad enough to laugh at . I've definitely seen worse , but trust your memory - - this one is a dog . If you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and I salute your excellent judgement .
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it may look . His debut , Hustle and Flow , was one of my favorites from that year , with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic , fallible characters . I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort . The cast seemed great , the trailer used music effectively , however , it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity , and fast . Fortunately , Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on . The acting is astonishing , the writing superb , and the editing style , as well as juxtaposed music , riveting the whole way . Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption . < br / > < br / > The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning . Like he did with Hustle and Flow , Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically . The 70 ' s aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best . From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae , each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross . The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose . Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother . Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation  Rae to sex and Laz to the bottle . Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear . < br / > < br / > Samuel L . Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him . There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive / patient . You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well . Also , the character of Rae is not chained up for very long , despite what the trailers would have you believe . The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two . As for that chained girl , Christina Ricci really shines . I never really saw her as anything special , but this role is a true breakthrough for her . This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down . Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away . Her nymphomania is not for pleasure , but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids . Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism . Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake , again showing some real acting talent . Where this guy came from I have no clue , but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out . < br / > < br / > While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow , Moan still ranks equally to it , in my mind , because when it is on , it is spectacular . Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with " This Little Light of Mine " singing out , and earlier , the interaction between captive and captor , when the chain is first introduced , shows some top-notch work . The truly magical moment , though , is when Jackson sings ( yes that is him throughout , like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle ) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker . If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year , I won't be surprised . What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of . One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes . Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been , or how bad life has been , everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people . We don't have saints here , but fallible people looking to right their ship . If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness , no one really knows , but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could .
are you crazy or what ? this movie has talent who are you to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers ? i mean you must be watching some crappy version because if you had a proper version you wouldn't think its some low resolution game graphics .. < br / > < br / > this movie is for people who enjoy hongkong cinema the other side to what Asian people enjoy watching .. you are such a sellout .. hongkong cinema is totally different to that of Hollywood , hk cinema is in a class of its own ... < br / > < br / > so if you don't enjoy watching movies from hongkong producers don't go and ramble on about how its a waste of time to watch .. just let other people enjoy the movie .. < br / > < br / > and personally I've seen this movie and i love its story and the way it was made ..
This is absolute drivel , designed to shock and titillate the 60 ' s mindset . The acting is completely wooden , consisting mainly of ad-libbing , which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of , repetitively . < br / > < br / > The end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care . The one exception to this is the lead character " Joe " ( played by Joe Dallesandro ) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor ( either stoned , or the only one in the piece who can act ! ) Please don't think I don't " get " Warhol - this is plainly and simply a Stinker that should never have made it out of a film class .
If you're going to spoof James Bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter so step forward Jean Dujardin who captures perfectly the Connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of Rossiter thinking he is suave . Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can hold his own at karate . The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a Nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid . If there is a jarring note it is the leading lady , Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by Aure Atika . It's good for one viewing but that's about it .
" The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo . The dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic , but also a prime suspect in this death , and some other murders that occur at the theatre . ' The Phantom Killer ' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim ; so , it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . < br / > < br / > Milton Raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit . Helpfully , Dave O'Brien ( as Anthony " Tony " Woolrich ) does well in the lead role ; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him . O'Brien and cab driving sidekick Frank Jenks ( as Egbert " Romeo " Egglehoffer ) would have made a fine 1950s TV detective team . Leading lady Kay Aldridge ( as Claudia Moore ) and the supporting cast are also good . Unfortunately , the story becomes meandering , and anti-climactic . < br / > < br / > * * * The Phantom of 42nd Street ( 5/2 / 45 ) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien , Kay Aldridge , Frank Jenks
A very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation , which is all to rare these days . I would compare this film to The Day of the Jackal , another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal . The acting across the board is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist Carlos and as the Navy man who impersonates him . Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him . Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan . This is a very tense and effective film , and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it . The first half of the film is all set-up , as the Navy man prepares to impersonate Carlos . The second half is a breathless actioner , the action coming out of the characters and their situations , thus making it all the more gripping . A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked .
I watched this movie purely for the setting . It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of . The plot was predictable , the acting was mediorcre at best , the scares were all gross-outs , not true scares . < br / > < br / > I don't remember much of the plot , and I think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember . They didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula . At low tide , you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay , which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks . < br / > < br / > The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action ( and I'm using that term loosly ) scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings !
Fulci is one of my all time favorite Italian splatter directors . He is also a very good story teller mixing horror , the supernatural , and psychedelic themes altogether very well . This film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as " Voices From Beyond " . The story is simple as Fulci plays himself , a horror director . After years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that Fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered . He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people . < br / > < br / > Fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time . These films I don't believe he directed but certainly produced . Some of those films are " Massacre " directed by Andrea Bianchi ( Burial Ground ) , " Touch of Death " directed by Fulci , " The Murders Secret " and I can't remember the rest of the films . < br / > < br / > Nightmare Concert is a very underrated film , even by Fulci fans . But I loved this movie and have watched it many times already . It is sad that Fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and I do recommend it to any Fulci fan , whether you like it or not . 9/10 stars
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate . It is an hour and half waste of time , following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life . There is about twenty minutes of magic , and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments . Our actress are treated like pieces of ass , and seem to be perfectly happy with their position . The lead characters , these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store . You can't relate with them , hell you barely can understand them . The story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle , its no more than a volleyball match that doesn't last long enough to make up with this trashed script raped from the O . C .
The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the making of this film after the controversial , groundbreaking English punk band's break-up both happened before I was born . However , I started listening to their only album , " Never Mind the B * & % @ # & s , Here's the Sex Pistols " , in 2003 , when I was a teenager , and quickly became a big fan . I didn't see " The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle " until 2006 , but saw it a couple times that year , and thought it was pretty good ( certainly not great , but pretty good ) , even if I could only remember bits of it , and didn't see how it all connected . Seeing it a third time , nearly three years after the second , I didn't care much for it at all . I'm not even sure what I found so good about most of it in the first place ( can't remember now ) . < br / > < br / > This film is a mockumentary , in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members ; guitarist Steve Jones , credited here as " The Crook " ; drummer Paul Cook , credited as " The Tea-Maker " ; bassist Sid Vicious , credited as " The Gimmick " ; and John Lydon ( a . k . a . Johnny Rotten ) credited as " The Collaborator . " McLaren claims that he created the band ( and even the genre of punk rock ) as a scam to make money . He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd ( a . k . a . Helen of Troy ) , in various places where they go together . It's basically a hodgepodge of McLaren talking , Pistols songs , live footage of the band , fictional scenes ( often silly , strange ones ) , several cartoon sequences , etc . , all put together in one film , to tell the Pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way ! < br / > < br / > It has been well proved that McLaren is a liar , I know many have already pointed this out , including band members themselves . He was NOT the driving force of the band , he didn't create them ( nor did he invent punk rock , and The Sex Pistols weren't even the first punk band , though they were unique ) . The band members were the ones who made the band what it was . " The Filth and the Fury " , a much more believable film about the band from Julien Temple , who made this film , is told from the point of view of the band members , who contradict McLaren's claims . However , the dishonesty of " The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle " is not my biggest problem with it . If it were actually entertaining ( which I used to think it was to a certain extent ) , I would be able to overlook that , like I obviously used to be able to do . During my third viewing , apart from Sex Pistols songs , some live footage , and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence , it was pretty dull ! I found the " Who Killed Bambi " song mildly amusing at first , but it got tiring very quickly . < br / > < br / > Is this mockumentary worth watching for Sex Pistols fans ? It seems a good number of fans would say it is , not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking 70 ' s punk band , but for entertainment . That was once my opinion on " The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle " . After the first time I watched it , I couldn't remember a thing McLaren said , and by the time I saw it the second time , I was aware of what the Pistols manager was using this film to imply , but could still barely remember anything I heard him say ! Obviously , other aspects of the film were what I found impressive . Now , after my third viewing , I can definitely remember some of the things McLaren says , but it still wasn't 100 % clear . Like most of the film , I guess his words are not that memorable , probably because of the way they're presented . If you're a Pistols fan , I guess it wouldn't hurt to give " Swindle " a try , but to me , for the most part , it's just an incoherent , boring mess that tries to be funny but fails .
When I was younger , and today , Mr . Bean is a work of genius . Three-time BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent ( miming ) human looking alien dropped onto Earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes . He has tried to do an exam , put his pants on in front of blind man ( he didn't know he was blind ) , gone to church , tried to dive at a swimming pool , made lunch on a park bench , seen a scary movie , changed in his car , had a picnic with a fly intruding , spent Christmas with his girlfriend ( Matilda Ziegler ) , looked after a baby in Portsmouth , been to Room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth , won a pet contest with his Teddy , driven on top of his Mini on a new chair , and even met and knocked out the Queen . Guests included Rudolph Walker , Richard Briers , Angus Deayton , Nick Hancock from They Think It's All Over , Caroline Quentin , The Day Today's David Schneider , Richard Wilson , The Fast Show's Eryl Maynard and The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack . It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Comedy ( Programme or Series ) and Best Light Entertainment Programme . Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 24 on The Comedians ' Comedian , and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian . Outstanding !
This is a truly wonderful love story . I liked the songs , however even if you do not , you have to love the story . Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is doing fine as well . I first saw this when I was about 13 and loved it then . Now in my forties , I still enjoy it , probably even more . Still makes me cry and laugh and feel good . It is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick . But whats wrong with that . Need a little romance and maybe a little cry , try this movie . < br / > < br / >
* * * Possable spoiler but probably not * * * < br / > < br / > The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it < br / > < br / > anymore ! Diddy is gone aswell ! < br / > < br / > The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two all time favorite < br / > < br / > Super Nintendo games . ( The other being Super Mario World ) < br / > < br / > The 2nd Donkey Kong at least had diddy kong and good levels , < br / > < br / > although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times . < br / > < br / > However this one is the worst of the lot ! It does not have the feel of < br / > < br / > the original or 2nd , The enemy's look stupid and the levels are < br / > < br / > even worse . It does not look realistic anymore ! I did not enjoy his game unlike the last two , the first had great < br / > < br / > background music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in this < br / > < br / > game is horrible ! < br / > < br / > It happens a lot these days that movies , shows and sometimes < br / > < br / > video games that start out fantastic , end up with it being ruined by < br / > < br / > a stupid sequel ! I am sad to say I feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good < br / > < br / > now that it has Donkey Kong 3 ! < br / > < br / > They should have left it at the original or MAYBE the 2nd one .
This film offers you a fascinating trip through one of the most exiting cities of today - Istanbul - and its musicians . Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or anything like that . Alexander Hacke , a German musician and member of the cult band " Einstürzende Neubauten " travels to Istanbul to get to know the music scene . His sparse voice overs of what he experiences are a guiding line through the film . But mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets various artists from Istanbul do the talking - and of course their music . < br / > < br / > You meet a variety of personalities , big stars and street musicians , young and old , people playing many different musical styles . But this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of Istanbul . It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has forged ahead in the last decade . The film characterises its protagonists with subtle humour , but never without respect . All of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power . < br / > < br / > Akin again shows his talent to portray diversity lightheartedly when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes . After his award winning feature film " Gegen die Wand " ( Head on ) Faith Akin proves with " Crossing the Bridge " that he is equally able to touch , entertain and guide his audience in a documentary . If you have never been in Istanbul , you will want to go there after having seen the film .
< br / > < br / > Never ever take a film just for its good looking title . < br / > < br / > Although it all starts well , the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films . Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film , so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious . < br / > < br / > A film to be listed on top of the garbage list . < br / > < br / >
Seeing the title of this movie " Stupid Teenagers Must Die " made me believe this was a spoof of some kind . I discovered later on the original title was " Blood and Guts " . Both titles are misleading , though . This is not a spoof , neither a serious splatter movie . This is something in between , failing in both areas . A group of teenagers is attending a séance at a spooky house and then the killing starts . Sounds over familiar , doesn't it . Well , this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies . And it is badly made . Because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy . Now this effect can be highly effective , but it isn't in this case . The young cast isn't acting too badly , but the director has no clue as what to do with actors . In numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions , but these are given too late . It could also be an editor's mistake , of course . The characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks . The sound is terrible at times : conversations are undecipherable , but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed . < br / > < br / > This is not the worst horror movie I have ever seen , but it still is a bad one . For me a 3 out of 10 .
Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same . Story is about the Travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of Matt ( Kip Pardue ) who was a very promising high school swimmer . Ben ( Jeff Daniels ) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son Tim ( Emile Hirsch ) as well as Matt but he does communicate ( of some sort ) to his mother Sandy ( Sigourney Weaver ) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it . < br / > < br / > * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * Sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail . She doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has taken a leave of absence from work . After all this happens Sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces Ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family . < br / > < br / > This film is written and directed by Dan Harris who has worked with Bryan Singer on " X2 " and also the upcoming Superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story ( for me ) just has too many things thrown in . The script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs , sex , love , infidelity , abuse , neglect , experimentation with homosexuality , and a life threatening illness . If all those scenarios weren't enough for you Harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim . While I did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another I must admit that I didn't hate this film and I have to credit the actors for that . Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but I wish the story would have concentrated more on Weaver and her character than Hirsch . Weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an Oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door . Harris shows he can be a good writer / director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived .
Strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context , the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing , the clear attempt at dry / black / dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke . < br / > < br / > With a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio I was shocked this show went pass the first season , I personally like Scrubs , The Office , 30 Rock , Trailer Park Boys , Pulling , Peep Show , Simpsons , Family Guy and I know what your thinking , these shows aren't weird at all , so some other good shows I've seen are Jam , Garth Marenghi's Darkplace , The Book Group , Asylum and Snuff Box which are original with dry / black / dark humour / satire and are all at least 5/10 . < br / > < br / > Garth Marenghi's Darkplace especially is cheap looking , overacted and weird , however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too .
The sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading actress is chubby , and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ... ! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading . If you expect to to see Piranhas , you might be disappointed . This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981 . Actually , I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas . < br / > < br / > The only thing that I liked about this movie , besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes , is the song at the end . It's written and sung by Jim Stein and it's called " Love all things that love the sun " . < br / > < br / > I don't recommend this movie . It is so bad it's not even funny to watch . I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I am the kind of person who watches anything .
It's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and I agree . < br / > < br / > If Mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe , not kicking around in some little town . < br / > < br / > I've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts I flip the channel . < br / > < br / > I watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed ( for the better I'd hoped ) but nope , same old " we're so clever with our references to pop culture " that I nearly barfed . < br / > < br / > Long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops .
Quick summary of the book : Boy , Billy Tepper , about 12 years old is school's main trouble maker , and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to boarding school . His upscale boy's school in Switzerland ( or somewhere like it ) gets taken over by Arab terrorists , why I'm not really sure . Billy has no friends , and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database . He , with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists ' plans , and save the entire school . The book wasn't bad , but was sooo cliché . < br / > < br / > Now about the movie ; they switched Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists , and make Billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends . They like to get into trouble , but normal teenage stuff . This movie was believable . Maybe not realistic , but the characters are real . You can watch Billy , Joey , and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did ( or at least wanting to ) . < br / > < br / > Great action scenes . Not everything goes as planned for either side . Overthrowing the terrorists was messy , and good guys did get hurt . I won't say who , but it is heart wrenching ( I know , I use that word a lot ) . Sean Astin is excellent . As a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend . This movie proved once again that he could play the leading man , kid , whatever . The only performance that may have upstaged his was Wil Wheaton's , who played the only son of a New Jersey mafia man . He hated his father , and everything he stood for . ( A far cry from Wesley Crusher ) Usually this genre of film is one I watch for the soul purpose of making fun ; but not Toy Soldiers . The story line flows , the dialogue is usually believable . I can't think of a single moment where I found myself shouting at the TV " Oh that would so not happen " Great movie that should be in everyone's collection .
A friend of mine asked : " Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie ? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives ? " Interesting questions . < br / > < br / > As far as I can see ( correct me if I'm wrong ) , there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside . Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well . It is he who wants to die . It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death . He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics . Though his pioneering work , depending on one's perspective , may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road , his primary objective is a personal one . But one thing this movie does ( my opinion anyway ) , is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth . < br / > < br / > After my first viewing of The Sea Inside , I walked home in a conflicted blur . I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion ; why would Ramón want to die ? Given the love , care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him , why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision ? Then , on my second viewing , a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness . It threw up a telling observation : " ... total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy . " Most human beings crave for such an intimacy . Of course , how much we value such " needs " , depends largely on the individual . < br / > < br / > As a person with a familial-biased sensibility , I empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie . Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends ? Is he blind to it all ? I would think not . The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore , is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war . When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one , whom has expressed a calm , conscious and rational intent to die , what then is the right thing to do ? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive , against his or her will , a pious gesture ? Does it show up the worth of our love ? Or does it merely soothe our " selfish " fears of irreplaceable loss ? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers , wouldn't their invalid charges , by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival , also be an overlooked act of sacrifice ? Rhetorical or not , how much is " dignity " worth to an individual ? Is living ( or dying ) with dignity a privilege or a right ? If we really care and love a person , should we also respect their eventual decisions in life ( as in death ) ? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked , answers to which , I'm in no position to provide . < br / > < br / > In our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice , we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected , the caregivers and the ones they care for . The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them . Intuitively , this film understands one thing ; that the nature of " sacrifice " is never one-sided . In this tug of war , we should endeavour not to win arguments , but to intently observe and hopefully determine , who is the " stronger " party to make that sacrifice . < br / > < br / > The Sea Inside is a sobering film . It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see . And for that , I am grateful .
I first saw this as a kid ( THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born ) and fairly recently bought this on DVD . In between , I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 ) the pie fight itself and 2 ) how racist some of these parts were : Farina as a Nubian slave , doing voodoo , for example . I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now . < br / > < br / > Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges ' HALFWITS ' HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this one ... and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures . There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films ... remember , at that time , they all stole from the best , each other ! ! ! < br / > < br / > One more note : Laurel & Hardy buffs , that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn , who also appeared in TBOTC-the ' flapper ' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end . It always escapes me why she was never credited ?
Terrible . Absolutely terrible . Long , confusing and unrewarding . After about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin . Not even the magnificent , sexy , beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work . The plot drags and drags and time goes by slowly and suddenly you realize that you don't even have any idea of what's going on anymore . By the end even with the usual explanation by the villain there's still a lot that's left unexplained and then it's over . A complete waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst adaptation's to bear the name of Agatha Christie .
A vampire prince falls for a human girl , unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter . That's the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from " Underworld " and " Buffy The Vampire Slayer " but manages to maintain a style of its own . I was bemused by the UK and Hong Kong title " The Twins Effect " as there are no twins involved in the story . It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who perform as " The Twins " . Don't let this put you off . These girls can act ( at least well enough for this type of film ) and add a lot of charm to the proceedings . Jackie Chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings . All in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue-in-cheek humour .
This was one of the dullest movies I have seen in some time . I'm in my late 40s , and watched it with my son-in-law ( early 20s ) and son ( 17 ) . The scenery was beautiful , but the story was a bust . We watched about an hour of it and turned it off . I spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than I spent actually watching the movie . I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and cinematography ; otherwise I would have given it a 1 . I'm sure there are people who are really into the " art " of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions , right ? I couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a " chick flick " where the focus was on the mother , or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys , with the focus on battle and adventure . In my opinion , it didn't succeed in either .
bottom at its absolute highest perfection . who ever says slap stick comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong . not that this film will only appeal to those who are of a masculine nature . this is another quality British dark comedy with many many jokes not violence related , but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all . < br / > < br / > this is a true example of thriving British ingenuity and homegrown talent hats off to them . on a performance level it reminds me very much of the early works of the marx brothers where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion are present in their acting styles , resulting in a performance where the audience can really engage the innate human desire to see others suffer , yet to be detached and still feel safe , much like the principle many TV chat shows operate on . a truly marvelous bit of manipulation leaving all parties feeling better off .
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show . It is so boring . The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny . It's like , Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background . My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other , " What's so funny ? ! ! " . Seriously , every time we watched that show , you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing . Just a blank look . So we stop watching it . I am personally a fan of sitcoms , so I tried to watch the show . But the show us such a disappointment . This show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever ...
Michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too Hollywood for the intellectual crowd but I found it both extremely funny and very touching , despite it being both cutesy and formulaic . < br / > < br / > When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid-western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation . < br / > < br / > When taking this film apart , as with most films today , there isn't a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off-beat enough to entertain one all the way through . < br / > < br / > While not being a " Family " film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone . < br / > < br / > " Michael " isn't a great film but it certainly is a good film , a touching film , and well worth seeing . < br / > < br / > KWC
If I could give this movie less than a 1 , I would certainly do that . I had read a review of this film in the LA Times and I found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review . My wife and I were game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critic said - you know critics . Sure enough ... Give me a break with the awful acting , horrible camera work , poor use of the budget ( that has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse ) . I've worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better . It's the Director and the Producer that makes films work - they choose the teams . That's it . If they don't put it together and make it work ... it simply won't . So , they didn't - and it doesn't . I don't think they can ... I just had to take the time to write this review ... though I'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well , but - in another career . Good luck .
This film is just really Great . I don't know why . I alway have a weakness for Damian Chapa . It's not Scarface , but still I really enjoyed my self . This is a film I can see more than ten times . He really try's to make a good movie , but he just can't do it . I feel pity for him , so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote . I can't help it , but I just can't give it less than 9 stars . Everyone should have seen this once in his life . To see how to make a cheap film work . I live in Holland and bought this film for only one euro ! That's 1,50 dollar . I would have also bought it for ten euro . Great Great Great . On a little dutch film site this film gets a 101 votes . Here only a 260 . That's not so much more . So people all over the world . Buy this movie !
Brilliant Biographic FILM .. < br / > < br / > Well this certainly is one of my very fav . Biographic movie . This movie came as a Total Surprise to me . I had been avoiding this movie for a very very Long time . Now that was because I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx . I still am not a Big Fan of him But I sure am a FAN now . < br / > < br / > Well He deserved every BIT of that Oscar . His performance is one of the BEST performances I have seen in a Long Long time . He is truly Sensational ! < br / > < br / > Well the narration , or the Flow of the story is Brilliant for a Biographical movie . I am a DRAMA fan so I wasn't bored at all . < br / > < br / > I was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that I did not see any flaws in the movie . I think there isn't any flaw in the movie . Maybe some Events errors But hey who Cares ? < br / > < br / > The performance by the woman who plays ray's Mother was also really GOOD . And well Kerry Washington she has so much Potential .. if given the right role She might just be the Next Oscar winner . < br / > < br / > Well the Story of them movie was so EMOTIONAL so TOUCHING .. I Cried I Cried very Badly < br / > < br / > I don't give a damn if the things were mad - up or not cuz this movie mad me cry And that's a lot for me ! < br / > < br / > All in all a SUPERB FILM . One of the very best of this century ! < br / > < br / > 10/10
